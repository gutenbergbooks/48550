<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following pages make no pretension to a detailed
history of the military operations of the Kaffir War.
Written during leisure hours, in a lonely fort, or by the
camp fire after the fatigues of the day, and mainly
embracing the movements of one Division only&mdash;often
of a Single Brigade or Corps&mdash;they attempt merely to
convey a general idea of the country, and of the scenes
and passing events of the Campaign. Should any
comrade who shared its dangers and hardships peruse
this account, it is hoped he will also share the feeling
which first prompted the Author to record them in
the Field and now to present the narrative to the
public&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
ORDERED TO THE CAPE&mdash;VOYAGE OUT.</h2>


<p>The service companies of the 74th Highlanders were
under orders to sail from Cork for Gibraltar early in
March, 1851. Our heavy baggage had already been sent
by a sailing vessel to anticipate our arrival, H.M.S.S.
"Vulcan" lay at Queenstown ready to take us on board,
and the all-engrossing topics were the cork-woods of
Andalusia, yachting in the Bay of Algesiras, or the
chances of future quarters among the olive-groves of
Corfu; when, in consequence of tidings received by
government of the serious aspect of affairs in British
Kaffraria, and the urgent demands of Sir H. Smith for
fresh troops, our orders were suddenly countermanded,
and, at three days' notice, we were steaming out of harbour
for the seat of the Kaffir war.</p>

<p>We weighed anchor on a bright Sunday morning, March
16th, after a hasty scramble in the short time left us to
lay in stores for the additional length of voyage, and get
an outfit of rifles, pistols, saddles, and camp equipage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
with a few shirts, boots, and other articles for the use of
the outer man, absolutely necessary to supply the loss of
our unlucky baggage, by that time some hundreds of
miles away in a different direction. No friends or relatives
accompanied us on embarkation to say farewell;
no pressing of hands or waving handkerchiefs. Lounging
groups of Sunday-dressed sailors smoked and looked
on in indifference; the bells rang out merrily, and the
church-going crowds wended their way along the quiet
sunny streets as usual.</p>

<p>The sister service, however, bade us a hearty farewell;
having got steam up, and sails set, in less than forty
minutes after the Admiral's signal, three-times-three lusty
cheers burst from the manned yards and rigging of the
"Ajax" and "Hogue," as we swept swiftly past, which
were returned with such right good will, that we made
but a very hoarse return to a last parting cheer from the
forts at the mouth of the harbour.</p>

<p>The church bells softened and died away in the distance;
streets, villas, and shipping grew indistinct; the
fast-receding shores dwindled to a narrow strip; the long
blue undulating line sank below the horizon; and we
were fairly standing out to sea.</p>

<p>We steamed away, ate and drank, and preached to
the fishes occasionally, as the breeze freshened rather
disagreeably; until, on entering the Bay of Biscay, it
began to blow in hard earnest, and by the fourth day
had risen to a furious gale; mountains of waves reaching
often to the yard-arms, and squalls coming on so
suddenly, as to cause serious fears lest the masts should
go overboard. At last it blew a perfect hurricane, with
such a tremendous sea running as I had never witnessed
in crossing the Atlantic before. In the height of the
howling din and confusion, the tiller ropes broke, and
were righted, after some time, with great difficulty. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
night the violence of the storm was unabated; the sea
washed the decks every other wave; the tiller ropes
again gave way, and once more we were drifting before
the tempest. It was impossible to stay below in such a
state of peril and uncertainty, and all the officers assembled
on deck. The roaring of the wind through the
rigging was so deafening, that we could not make ourselves
heard, and all stood in silence watching the storm.
One of the sailors aloft, whose perilous position we had
been remarking, was jerked off the main-topsail yard-arm,
and falling on the deck with a fearful crash, was
killed on the spot. The foretop-mast was sprung, and
immediately afterwards the mess-room ports were stove
in, and floods of water poured through, and surged from
side to side of the cabin with the heavy rolling, breaking
over the table at every lurch. By the glimmer of a
single lamp, officers and men hazarded neck and limbs
in desperate attempts to secure, and lash together, the
large hampers, chests, and heavy casks of sea-stores,
which were dashed violently up and down the stateroom.</p>

<p>After seeing all secured, and making a meal of biscuit
and salt beef as we stood, bare-legged and soaked to the
skin, we waded to our flooded berths, and turned in for
the night, though the uproar was so terrific that it was
impossible to sleep. In the midst of the din, came
another astounding crash of barrels and chests broken
loose; some bursting through the cabin doors as if they
had been chip. Officers and men, dressed and undressed,
turned out, and all were again at work lashing and
making fast.</p>

<p>In the morning, the jolly-boat, weighing about a
couple of tons, was found high above the davits, blown
against the rigging, and a valuable charger of the Colonel's
killed. All this time, the wind was dead on the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
coast of Spain, and we were obliged to wear ship constantly,
driving about between Ushant and Scilly, till at
the end of eight days we had the peculiar satisfaction of
finding ourselves a trifle nearer England than on the
first.</p>

<p>"Post nubila Ph&oelig;bus." After the black and angry
Bay of Biscay, the sunny tropics. The gale moderated,
and by the 6th of April we had entered the torrid zone;
awnings were spread on deck, and the band played
in the evenings, which closed with the most gorgeous
sunsets. The only land seen since leaving port, was St.
Antonio, one of the Cape de Verde islands, about twenty
miles off, which we sighted as the setting sun lit up its
rugged sides with the richest tints of purple and gold.</p>

<p>On the 16th we crossed the Line, where, with grave
circumstance and ceremony, the uninitiated were made
freemasons by Neptune and his court in person, after
being well lathered with pipe-clay and mops, shaved
with three-feet razors, soundly ducked, and afterwards
rinsed by liberal applications of the fire-engine hose and
water-buckets. On reaching the southerly "trades" we
were right glad to get rid of the stifling heat, and clanking
of the engine, and spread canvass once more.</p>

<p>A succession of tropical calms, in which we were,
nearly roasted; and tropical showers, in which we were
as nearly drowned, ensued. The beautiful "Southern-cross,"
"Centaur," and other, to us new, constellations,
now shone out nightly with surpassing brilliancy; and
bonetas, sharks, dolphins, Cape-pigeons, and albatrosses,
with flying-fish innumerable, played around the ship day
after day; some of the latter gratifying our curiosity
by a visit through the ports.</p>

<p>After a monotonous voyage of more than seven weeks,
we, one fine evening, sighted what the landsmen took
to be a hazy bank of cloud in the extreme horizon, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the sailors declared most positively to be land, with so
many and extraordinary maledictions on themselves and
personal property generally, that they ought to have felt
considerably relieved when daylight the following morning
put it beyond a doubt. Long before the hour of
breakfast, our usual meet, every one was on deck gazing
at the distant mountains and bold headlands of the
Cape, which rapidly grew more distinct as we approached
them with a fresh breeze in our favour, a magnificent
sea running mountains high. Late in the day the scattered
houses became visible along the welcome shore,
and we entered Simon's Bay.</p>

<p>The little town&mdash;a group of flat-roofed white and
yellow houses, with Venetian shutters and wide verandahs&mdash;is
prettily situated at the foot of a mountain,
fringed with bushes. American aloes and cactus form
luxuriant hedges round the gardens, and flourish to an
immense size; picturesque groups of swarthy Malays, in
huge beehive-shaped hats, or red and yellow bandanas,
gazed at us from the shore, or pulled alongside, vociferating
in Dutch, and offering melons, pumpkins, eggs,
and fruit, for sale.</p>

<p>Next day we went ashore, while the women and children
were being disembarked to remain behind at Cape
Town, and the rest of our camp equipage was got on
board, and took advantage of the opportunity to make
a rapid survey of the immediate neighbourhood, and
stretch our legs after nearly two months imprisonment
on board ship. As we strolled along the street we were
much struck with the skill and ease with which the
native Africanders drove their waggons, eight and ten
in hand, full trot round the most difficult corners, an
assistant wielding an enormous whip with both hands;
and during our rambles were delighted to find the most
exquisite specimens of our greenhouse <i>ericas</i> wild on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
mountain sides. The evening was warm and lovely,
and the perfume of the creepers and flowering trees
most delicious, as we walked in the bright moonlight;
not a sound was heard but the rippling of the waves and
the shrill cry of the cicada, and we very reluctantly left
the refreshing repose of the quiet shore to go on board
again.</p>

<p>The following morning, at a signal from the Commodore,
we steamed out of the harbour, and shaped our
course for Algoa Bay, a run of about three hundred
miles, along a wild, and almost uninhabited coast.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
STATE OF THE COUNTRY ON ARRIVAL.</h2>


<p>On arriving in Simon's Bay our first anxiety, of course,
was to learn the latest tidings from the seat of war,
which fully confirmed the unfavourable intelligence
that had led to our sudden change of destination. The
natives were in open rebellion, plundering the frontier
farms, attacking post after post, and committing the
most deliberate outrages and murders; and all the
efforts of Sir Harry Smith to check them were comparatively
ineffectual without fresh reinforcements, which he
was now anxiously expecting.</p>

<p>It was at last but too evident, even to the most
sanguine advocates of peace, that all hopes of such a
desirable consummation being permanently effected in
the colony were at end, so far as depended on any
promises or treaties of the faithless Kaffirs. The experiment
had been fairly tried again and again, and had
as often failed. Never had there been such encouragement
to hope for ultimate success as in the decided improvement
and progress effected during the few years
which had elapsed since the last war, after the conferences
of December 24, 1847, and January 7, 1848, at
King William's Town.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of that war it was found absolutely
necessary, for the future safety and peace of the colony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to extend the frontier line of our possessions to the
Great Kei River, including the large district named
British Kaffraria, which, with the lately "Ceded Territory,"
were declared to be forfeited by the vanquished
Kaffirs, as the penalty of their rebellion. In point of
fact, however, they were left in possession of the country,
each tribe, with their respective chiefs, being assigned to
different districts, the whole under a system of government
by local magistrates or commissioners, who were
again subordinate to Colonel Mackinnon, the Commandant
and Chief Commissioner at King William's
Town. The condition on which they were allowed
to retain occupation of these districts was that of declaring
allegiance to the Crown, with which both Chiefs
and people at once complied; and, in addition to
this, and in accordance with their own laws, each Chief
was made responsible for any cattle or other robberies,
the spoor of which could be traced to his kraal, he
having to pay the full value, and follow up the spoor as
best he could. The result was, that as there could thus
be no receivers, there were soon few thieves, and property
became comparatively secure, order being further
enforced and preserved by a body of 400 Kaffir police,
regularly drilled and equipped. The blessings of order
and an equitable administration of justice inspired a
confidence which was gradually felt by the people to be
far preferable to the arbitrary and capricious rule of
their chiefs, supported as it was by the grossest superstitions
and impostures; and, besides this, efforts were
made to improve their moral condition, every encouragement
being given to missionary exertions, and the opening
of schools and places of worship, with abundant
success.</p>

<p>Admirable however as was Sir H. Smith's system,
and also its working,&mdash;for, as was remarked, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
could be more promising than the state of the country
up to the autumn of 1850,&mdash;an element was at work,
the importance of which had not been duly estimated,
and to which may undoubtedly be traced the origin of
the subsequent war. The chiefs found their power and
influence melting daily before the advance of civilization,
the settled habits of peace, and the irresistible superiority
of a just and duly administered government.
Naturally jealous of their hereditary power, they felt it
would soon be superseded; and Sandilli, their Paramount
Chief, and an accomplished Kaffir diplomatist,
availing himself of this state of feeling, visited all the
several chiefs, and urged on them the necessity of a last
struggle for their waning independence, instigating them
to use every means to spread disaffection among their
people. To further his views he enlisted the services of
Umlanjeni, one of their <i>Witch-doctors</i> and prophets, in
whose predictions, the most absurd and preposterous, the
Kaffirs placed superstitious faith. His influence was
extraordinary, and spread like wildfire among them, and
the spirit of disaffection was once more deeply at work.
Secret and active emissaries were sent far and wide to
the Kaffirs located on the different farms in the service
of colonists, with orders to desert their employers, which
they promptly obeyed, absconding without warning, and in
many instances leaving their property and wages behind.</p>

<p>At length, in spite of the reluctance of the authorities
to believe in any hostile intentions on the part of the
enemy, the truth of such suspicions became so apparent,
that intelligence of the unsettled state of affairs,
and an expected movement, was despatched to Sir Harry
Smith at Cape Town. He suddenly appeared on the
spot, and immediately commenced personal inquiries,
and the now thoroughly alarmed colonists presented an
address urging the real remedy for the apprehended disturbances,&mdash;viz.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the complete deposition of the chiefs
from power, by depriving them of all independent
authority. In absence, however, of any "direct evidence"
that they were engaged in plotting an attack,
and persuaded by their specious promises and affected
submission, Sir H. Smith, in his reply of October 24,
1850, said, "that reports throughout British Kaffraria
were most satisfactory, the chiefs were astounded at his
sudden arrival, and he hoped to arrest some of the Kaffirs
who had spread the alarming reports."</p>

<p>His prompt and energetic appearance, though without
any troops whatever, alone averted an immediate outbreak,
and at a great assembly of the Chiefs at King
William's Town they swore allegiance to the government,
ratifying it by kissing the "stick of peace." The
crafty Sandilli however refused to attend, and for his
contumacy was shortly after deposed by proclamation,
and on the 18th of November the Governor, after endeavouring
to reassure the frontier settlers, and induce
them to return to their farms, departed for Cape Town
in the hopes that all would remain tranquil.</p>

<p>But a Commission appointed by the Governor to proceed
to the country of Hermanus to investigate the
numerous complaints of depredations, forwarded to Cape
Town such an alarming account of the critical state of
affairs that his Excellency immediately started in the
"Hermes," and within less than a month from his leaving
it, was again on the Frontier, landing at Buffalo mouth
with the 73rd regiment and a detachment of artillery.
A proclamation was at once issued for the establishment
of a police, and the enrolment of a corps of volunteers for
self-defence, so as to leave the whole of the military at
liberty for operations.</p>

<p>The Kaffirs at this time, according to returns, possessed
upwards of 3000 stand of arms, six million rounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of ball cartridge, and half a million assegais, with ample
means of supply; a trade in gunpowder and arms having
long been carried on openly and almost without restriction.
Their fanatical prophet, Umlanjeni, now issued the
command to "Slay and eat," which, as the usual food of
the Kaffirs in time of peace is corn, roots, and sour milk,
is the conventional mode with them of commencing
a war, the stimulus of animal food being only resorted to,
to excite their energies on such occasions; their warlike
passions fairly aroused, farms were attacked in every direction,
houses plundered and burned, and the police
effectually resisted in their attempts to enforce the restitution
of stolen cattle.</p>

<p>A panic spread along the Frontier, and the farmers
abandoned their lands in numbers, moving with all their
flocks and herds into the interior, their losses being
greatly aggravated by the swarms of locusts which devoured
everything before them, leaving the cattle to
perish for want of pasture. Those who had the courage,
or were compelled by necessity to remain, formed themselves
into <i>laagers</i> of ten or twelve families, regularly
fortifying and provisioning themselves within some of
the more tenable homesteads, round which they collected
their flocks.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-chief, on the 16th December,
marched all the troops in Albany and British Kaffraria
to the Amatola mountains, the object of which was to
make such a demonstration as might overawe the Gaikas,
without resorting to force, which was to be carefully
avoided. The troops consisted of the 6th, 73rd, and 91st
regiments, and the Cape Mounted Rifles, together, about
1500 strong, with the two divisions of Kaffir police. The
right wing, under Lieut.-Col. Eyre, 73rd, was posted on
the Kabousie Neck, accompanied by the Chief Toise;
the centre column, under Col. Mackinnon, held Fort Cox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the head-quarters of his Excellency; and Col. Somerset,
in command of the left wing, moved on Fort Hare.</p>

<p>On the 19th a great meeting of all the Gaika tribes
and chiefs was held at Fort Cox, when above 3000 assembled,
and were addressed by the Governor on the conduct
of Sandilli, who, with his half-brother Anta, was
outlawed, and large rewards offered for their apprehension.
His Excellency impressed on them his determination
to preserve order, and, if needful, to enforce it by the
troops; but they had, no doubt, already fully resolved on
war, and must have felt pretty confident in the strength
of their position and forces, for on his threatening them
that, in case of necessity, he could bring ships full of
troops to the Buffalo mouth, he was significantly asked,
"If he had any ships that could sail up the Amatolas?"</p>

<p>A few days later their hostile intentions were put beyond
a doubt. A patrol of 580 strong, under Colonel
Mackinnon, had been ordered out to the Keiskamma
Hoek, where Sandilli was supposed to be concealed, in
the expectation that he would surrender or fly, as the
Governor was led to believe. They marched from Fort
Cox on the 24th, with orders to molest no one, and were
treated in the most friendly manner by the Kaffirs until
they had reached a narrow, rocky gorge of the Keiskamma,
where they could only proceed in single file,
when a fire was suddenly opened on the column of infantry,
after the Kaffir Police and Cape Mounted Rifles
had been suffered to pass. The fire was most resolutely
maintained for some time, and the ground was so well
chosen for the attack, that the troops could not dislodge
the Kaffirs until they had suffered a considerable loss,
the mounted police and Cape corps being unavailable.
Assistant-Surgeon Stuart, and eleven men, were killed,
with two officers and seven privates wounded. The loss
of the enemy was considerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that the troops were purposely led
into this ambuscade by the Kaffir police, as they were
themselves not only allowed to pass unmolested during
the whole affair, but the next day a body of 365 deserted
to the enemy, taking their wives, cattle, equipments,
and ammunition, and, what was more annoying, the
discipline and knowledge of our military man&oelig;uvres,
both infantry and cavalry, which they had acquired from
a long course of active training, at an expense, to the
colony alone, of £11,000 annually. Their defection was
speedily followed by that of others. This day (Christmas
day) seems to have been agreed on as the commencement
of a general outbreak. Martial law had been proclaimed
by the governor, in consequence of the events of the day
before. A party of the 45th regiment, while escorting
waggons to King William's Town, was surprised on the
Debe Neck, and overpowered, before they could form for
defence, by a large body of Kaffirs, who barbarously
murdered the whole party, a sergeant and fourteen
privates, leaving their bodies on the ground, where they
were found by Colonel Mackinnon's patrol, with their
throats cut from ear to ear, and horribly mutilated, which
was afterwards discovered to have been perpetrated before
death. This party had formed a portion of the
handful of troops at Fort White, and the Kaffirs at once
proceeded to attack the weakened garrison, but were gallantly
repulsed with loss.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with these attacks they consummated
their cowardly treachery by a general and concerted
massacre at all the military villages, under circumstances
of the most atrocious and cold-blooded ferocity. These
military settlers were discharged soldiers, who had grants
of land assigned to them, with assistance from government
on a liberal scale to start them in their farms, the
condition of tenure being, that they should be ready at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
any time to turn out for the defence of the country,
receiving good pay and allowances while on service. A
number of prosperous little villages thus sprang up, and
the settlers lived on the most friendly terms with the
neighbouring Kaffirs, constantly entertaining them as
their guests, and employing many on their farms. Of
their hospitality the Kaffirs treacherously availed themselves
to the full, to allay suspicion and prepare the
way for the intended massacre. Hurried orders to prepare
themselves for the worst had but just arrived in
consequence of the attack at Keiskamma Hoek, on the
previous day, when the Kaffirs rose at a signal, and
massacred the inhabitants, whose guests many of them
had just been sharing their Christmas dinner. The
women were stripped, and escaped with difficulty, and
the houses were burned to the ground. Johannesberg,
Woburn, and Auckland, among others, were thus entirely
destroyed, every man at the latter being killed.</p>

<p>The Governor himself was next hemmed in by the
enemy at Fort Cox; a gallant attempt to open a communication
with him was made by Colonel Somerset,
with a party of the 91st regiment and Cape Mounted
Rifles, but they were compelled to abandon it, being surrounded
by overwhelming numbers of the enemy; and,
in a most desperate hand-to-hand fight, two gallant officers,
and twenty privates, of the 91st, were killed, and many
wounded. Their loss, however, was amply avenged,
some 200 of the enemy being left dead on the field.</p>

<p>On the 31st, Sir H. Smith, with a party of Cape
corps, sallied from Fort Cox, and after dashing through
the enemy for twelve miles, succeeded in reaching
King William's Town. He immediately issued a proclamation,
calling on the colonists to rise <i>en masse</i>, and
assist the troops to expel and exterminate the Gaikas
from the Amatolas, at all hazards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The prospects of the new year opened gloomily
enough; the attacks and depredations of the enemy became
daily more general and audacious. The farmers
entirely abandoned the country, and the roads were
almost impassable from the quantity of stock which
was driven in. The Gaikas were joined by the T'slambies
and Tambookies, mustering not less than 15,000
strong; and Kreli, the most influential chief, was under
suspicion, and his defection greatly dreaded, as he could
bring a force of at least 10,000 men into the field.</p>

<p>At this conjuncture the ill-concealed spirit of disaffection,
which had long been at work, broke out among
the Hottentots of the London Missionary Station, at the
Kat River, for years a hotbed of discontent and rebellion;
though actually fed and clothed at an enormous
expense by the government, and put in free possession
of a most beautiful and fertile district, taken by us from
the Kaffirs, and given to them unconditionally, yet these
people were taught to believe themselves injured, robbed,
and oppressed by those to whom they owed everything;
and now leagued themselves with Sandilli and his
followers.</p>

<p>The missionary settlements of Shiloh and Theopolis
quickly followed their example, and the so-called Christianized
Hottentots were soon among the foremost of
the rebels. At Shiloh they actually garrisoned and
held their chapel for some time against their Burgher
forces, though they had but shortly before received the
sacrament and sworn solemn allegiance. Afterwards,
being joined by a party of Tambookies and Kat River
rebels, they made a daring attack on Whittlesea.</p>

<p>As soon as Sir H. Smith reached King William's
Town, he despatched an urgent demand to Cape Town
for all available troops, and another appeal was made to
the Burghers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>While the Governor was awaiting the collection of these
reinforcements, the Kaffirs, emboldened by the delay,
sent an audacious challenge to our troops to fight, backed
by a body of 500 men, who, however, were signally
worsted by a party of Cape corps, and Fingoes.</p>

<p>As soon as the Commander-in-chief had somewhat
organized his forces, Colonel Mackinnon was despatched,
on the 30th of January, to throw supplies into Fort Cox
and Fort White, and, on the 13th of February, marched
with a patrol to the relief of Fort Hare, in all of which he
was successful, though after severe conflicts with the
enemy.</p>

<p>By this time the Kaffirs had overrun the whole country,
down even as far as Graham's Town and the Addo Bush,
and, in every direction, were perpetrating the most
violent outrages on life and property, to the utter dismay
and consternation of the inhabitants; and Sir H. Smith,
at the request of the English and Dutch churches, proclaimed
a solemn day of humiliation on the 7th February,
which was religiously observed.</p>

<p>Fort Armstrong, which the rebels had seized, was
stormed on the 23rd of February, and taken by Major-General
Somerset; and other engagements took place
with the same success, especially during patrols of a force
under Colonel Mackinnon.</p>

<p>In the beginning of March the Cape Mounted Rifles
followed the example of the Kat River rebels, a party of
them deserting from head-quarters, with all their arms
and accoutrements; and further desertions were only
checked by the promptness of the Governor, who at once
paraded the regiment, and disarmed the coloured men.</p>

<p>On the 18th the Commander-in-chief took the field in
person, and marched to Fort Hare, which was in imminent
danger of an attack for the rescue of prisoners and
the plunder of ammunition. By a masterly movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
this was frustrated, and the enemy utterly routed with
considerable loss. After this his Excellency pushed on
with a rapidity which astonished the Kaffirs, and marched
on Forts Cox and White; during which another spirited
engagement took place, the enemy being again defeated,
numbers of them killed, and above 1000 head of stolen
cattle retaken.</p>

<p>In consequence of an atrocious case of roasting three
men alive at the notorious Kat River, General Somerset,
with a strong patrol, marched to the Mancazana River,
where they were attacked by the enemy, who were completely
defeated. Major Wilmot, R.A., also on a patrol
into the Chief Seyolo's country, encountered and defeated
them; inflicting severe loss, driving Seyolo out, and destroying
their kraals and stores. Colonel Mackinnon and
Captain Tylden had, by the latest intelligence, successfully
opposed the enemy in other parts of the country,
and Marassa's people; but the troops were evidently inadequate,
in point of numbers, to the emergency, and the
vast extent of the line of operations; and the greatest
anxiety was felt, which was increased by the intelligence
of Kreli's having engaged in actual hostilities, in conjunction
with the Tambookies and Basutas.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, was the state of affairs when we left
Simon's Bay; and it was with feelings of some excitement
that we looked forward to joining the gallant little
army, which as anxiously expected our arrival.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
LANDING&mdash;MARCH UP THE COUNTRY&mdash;FIRST BRUSH WITH THE REBELS.</h2>


<p>On the fourth day after leaving Simon's Town, we
dropped anchor in Algoa Bay, opposite the town of Port
Elizabeth, which, though rather a dull-looking place at
first sight, with its background of bare sand-hills, improved
on better acquaintance.</p>

<p>Here the troops were transferred to large boats, from
which again, one by one, we were all carried ashore,
through a tremendous surf, sitting astride on the shoulders
of naked Fingoes; tall, athletic fellows, adorned with
armlets and necklaces of brass and beads, and wearing
pendant in front, a most grotesque and sometimes elaborate
ornament, which as much astonished our men, as it
excited their merriment. Our landing on the 16th of the
month was an odd coincidence, as we had sailed from
Cork on the 16th of March, and crossed the line on the
16th of April.</p>

<p>Towards evening the whole of the troops were landed,
and our tents pitched on the top of the bare bleak hill
behind the town.</p>

<p>Most of the bedding having got thoroughly soaked in
passing through the surf, many of us slept in our plaids
on the bare ground, which some of the youngsters rather
preferred, as a hardy soldier-like sort of thing.</p>

<p>Here we were detained three days, unable to procure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
sufficient oxen for the baggage waggons, as in consequence
of a long drought and scarcity of pasture the
cattle had died off in hundreds, those that survived
being in such a miserable plight that two could with
difficulty do the work of one in ordinary condition.</p>

<p>The camp was besieged from morning to night by
crowds of various races, Africanders, Hottentots, Malays,
and Fingoes, as different in costume as in complexion;
some gaily dressed in startling cottons, with gaudy
<i>douks</i> or bandanas on their woolly heads; others with
large brass skewers stuck Chinese fashion through their
long black hair; some wrapped in a simple cowhide, or
dirty blanket; and many with little encumbrance beyond
their brass and copper ornaments, or the naked
little niggers tied on their backs. Horses of all ages and
descriptions, from unbroken colts to broken-down screws,
and of all colours, from a "voss" to a "blue schimmel,"
were paraded for sale, and trotted up and down, spurred,
"jambokked," and gingered all day long. As every
officer required two animals, one for riding and another
for his pack-saddle, the demand greatly increased the
already high prices, and we had to pay at least double
their ordinary value.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after landing, tents were struck at
eight in the morning, and we marched through the long
straggling street of Port Elizabeth, accompanied for
some distance out of the town by a motley crowd,
screaming and dancing round the band. A long train
of about thirty lumbering waggons, each drawn by ten
or fourteen of the largest bullocks we had ever seen;
carrying immense and most inconvenient-looking horns,
brought up the rear. Naked little "voorloupiers"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> led
the teams, which were driven by dwarf Hottentots flourishing
enormous bamboo whips eighteen or twenty feet
in length, the incessant cracking of which was like the
report of so many pistols, as they descended with volleys
of Dutch oaths on the backs of the unfortunate oxen
answering to the names of Schwartlande, Bluberg, or
Scotlande.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>The country was most monotonous, and but for such
features of novelty as strange shrubs and plants presented,
uninteresting enough, being little more than a
succession of bare sandy flats, and low hills sprinkled
with bush, here and there a large salt-pan, and occasionally
clumps of aloes and elephant tree,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a large bush
with round fleshy leaves of an agreeable acid, the favourite
food of the elephant, which only a few years back
inhabited the whole of this district. The sun was
scorching hot; clouds of fine sand, raised by the moving
column, floated round, filling eyes and mouth; and
altogether the men (judging from their remarks) appeared
to entertain a very indifferent opinion of Africa.</p>

<p>After fourteen miles we came to the Zwartkop river,
and crossing the <i>drift</i> or ford, encamped among the
scattered mimosas, bristling with gigantic white thorns,
on a piece of short, smooth grass, at the foot of a hill,
completely covered with aloes, drawing up the waggons
in line, and <i>knee-haltering</i> the horses, which were turned
loose to feed with the oxen till dark.</p>

<p>A brilliant moon rose early, and we sat round a
cheerful camp-fire, smoking our first pipe in what might
be called the bush; the long lines of tents and white-topped
waggons peeped from among the dark trees,
bright fires encircled by red coats shone everywhere; the
oxen tied to the yokes lay grouped together, the horses
stood sleeping, the Hottentots scraped their fiddles and
screeched under their waggons, and in the distance the
sentinels paced up and down their beat; while above the
general hum, rose every now and then the loud laugh
and merry song, finishing occasionally with the mournful
howl of a jackal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>Next morning, after ascending the steep winding road
cut through a forest of large African aloes, we marched
to Coega River, where, learning that there was no water
to be had for the next twenty miles, we were obliged, on
account of the oxen, to halt for the day. We had good
sport at buck-shooting, and I got a beautiful tiger's skin
from a native who had but just stripped it from the
carcass of its late owner.</p>

<p>Owing to the general reluctance that had hitherto
been displayed to turning out of bed in the middle of
the night to march, we were aroused the following
morning at one o'clock, by the effectual but not very
agreeable mode, of pulling down the tents at the sound
of a bugle, without the ceremony of asking those within
whether they were prepared for a public appearance.</p>

<p>It was still bright moonlight when we <i>fell in</i>, and so
bitterly cold that our half-frozen fingers and toes had
hardly recovered their natural warmth when we halted
for breakfast, after a five-miles walk in rear of the snail-paced
waggons.</p>

<p>After two or three hours' grazing, the oxen were inspanned,
and our march continued for fifteen miles
through dense bush; the laborious track ankle deep in
soft sand, and so narrow in places that the waggons
could barely brush through, the men being obliged
to march in file. The sun was by this time intensely
hot, and we were without a drop of water to moisten our
lips, which were swollen and blistered by the heat.
Towards noon we came to a "poort," or natural hollow
between high banks covered with aloe and dwarf euphorbia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the sand thickly incrusted with salt. The
reflected heat of the sun was intolerable; not a breath of
air was stirring; all around was still as death, and the
atmosphere so stifling that many of the men were on the
point of fainting, though a few hours before benumbed
with cold. Shortly we came to a muddy stagnant pool,
literally hot from the noontide sun: but so great were
the sufferings of the troops, that they rushed almost
into it, throwing themselves down by sections on
the miry banks, and greedily drinking the fetid green
water.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we pitched our tents on a burning
plain; and never did I enjoy anything so much as
a bathe that evening in the gloomy crocodile-suggesting-stream,
called Sunday River, whose sluggish
water, overhung by deep forest, scarcely moved the
twigs that dipped into it. After this refresher, we
all dined together at the little lonely inn; the rooms
of which were covered, from the ceiling to the floor,
with the skins of lions and tigers; shot, as the host
assured us, "within sight of the house." During the
night, my tent pole, which had already shown rickety
symptoms, gave way from the overstraining of the
canvass, tightened by the dew, and down came the
wet tent on our faces, nearly smothering C&mdash;&mdash;n, my
companion in misfortune. We cut an odd figure in
the moonlight, in our shirts and red woollen caps,
creeping from under the fallen tent, and in that airy
costume clearing away the wreck, turning in again
between our blankets on the open plain; where, at
the risk of being walked over by orderly officers
and stray horses, we slept soundly until <i>réveillé</i>, when
awaking, I found every article of clothing thoroughly
saturated with dew; in spite of which, it was impossible
to resist laughing at the autumnal appearance of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
comrade, whose nightcap, hair, and eyebrows were
heavily loaded with sparkling dewdrops.</p>

<p>After about an hour's marching, the sun rose, and
we met a returning party of traders going down to
the Bay with several waggon-loads of skins, escorted
by about a score of naked Fingoes. In the forenoon
we arrived at Commando Kraal, where was an encampment
of Fingoe Levies, stationed at the entrance of
the dangerous Addo-bush, in which, a short time
previously, one or two rencounters with the Kaffirs had
taken place. A small party of them joined us, armed
with flint-locks and assegais, and dressed in the most
grotesque manner possible.</p>

<p>This dense and beautiful bush extends for miles on
every side; its solitary depths impassable except to
Kaffirs and wild beasts, hundreds of which latter roam
through it undisturbed. Tigers, hyænas, wild-cats, and
jackals abound; and buffaloes and elephants are still
occasionally seen, of which we had convincing evidence
in the fresh spoor of three of the latter, whose enormous
foot-prints were distinctly visible, and made one's
heart beat with excitement at the idea of being in a
country where such noble beasts roamed wild and unrestrained.
The waggon track was in many parts very
beautiful, sometimes so narrow that the overhanging
trees, covered with festoons of grey pendant lichen, met
above it; in others, opening out into smooth green
lawn-like patches, surrounded by brilliantly flowered
trees and shrubs (as the crimson boerboon,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the
yellow mimosa, with its gigantic milk-white thorns);
everywhere clusters of the beautiful pale blue plumbago,
with numberless aloes and occasional euphorbias,
rising to the height of thirty feet; the underwood filled
with the "stapelia," "gasteria," and other varieties of
cactus. The heat of the sun was again most oppressive,
shut in as we were between walls of bush, so close, that
not a breath of air found its way through. The oxen
were so completely done up, that they could scarcely
draw the heavily-laden waggons through the deep sand,
and numbers fell, to die on the roadside, or were
abandoned a prey to the wild beasts and vultures.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>Halting for half an hour to rest the cattle at the top
of a heavy hill, a lovely view presented itself: in the
foreground, the road we had just passed, winding down
into the bush below; beyond that, a vast extent of
flat, thickly-wooded country; and far off, a fine chain
of rugged mountains, mellowed by the purple atmosphere
of the distance, into a mistlike softness.</p>

<p>Late in the day, we entered on an extensive grassy
plain, affording a grateful relief to the eye, after the
close smothering road through the bush. Three distant
specks on the vast level proved, when we came up,
to be as many waggons outspanned by a large "vley"
or pool of water; their owners, a company of traders,
cooking supper and smoking their pipes, looked a
picture of ease and comfort, strongly contrasted with
our dusty and way worn appearance. We saw several
"duykerbok," and encamped at sunset, driving in our
last tent-pegs by the light of a beautiful moon.</p>

<p>Across this plain, thinly covered with brown burnt-up
grass, we marched the following day, for twelve miles,
in clouds of fine sand, borne along by a hot wind that
rendered it disagreeable and wearying in the extreme;
and without seeing anything to enliven or interest,
excepting a fine secretary bird and a number of tortoises;
two large <i>cobra capellas</i> were killed, one of which
bit a pet terrier-dog, that immediately began howling
and barking, running round and round, falling down
and foaming at the mouth. Its body swelled out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
enormously, and it soon afterwards died. We encamped
for the night at Bushman's River, where we were
only able to get a little thick stagnant water of the
colour and consistence of a dose of rhubarb, and were
on the road again by four, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; outspanning after
five miles for breakfast, by a pool of fresh water,
which was most welcome, after having had nothing
to drink for the last twenty-four hours but the single
draught of liquid mud. While searching in the thicket
for dry firewood, we came upon a colony of monkies,
which highly resented our intrusion, chattering and
gesticulating in the most angry manner.</p>

<p>Towards mid-day we came in sight of a small settlement,
with the exception of the solitary inn, the first
sign of human habitation we had seen for four days.
The houses, seven in number, standing in the open
plain, were enclosed by stockades, and barricaded
with boxes, bags, chests and barrels, filled with sand,
and piled up against the doors and windows; the
neat little English church, about which we found the few
inhabitants just assembling for divine service (it being
Sunday,) was loop-holed, and barricaded within by
furniture of all descriptions, an indication of our
approach to the neighbourhood of the disturbed districts.</p>

<p>Our route the following day lay for some miles
through an uninteresting succession of low, undulating
grassy hills, totally devoid of tree or bush, but thickly
covered with enormous ant-hills, many of them four
feet high, neatly built, rounded, and baked as hard
as stone.</p>

<p>At Assegai Bush we were met by a convoy of twenty
additional waggons, sent from Graham's Town, to
lighten our own, and enable us to proceed with greater
dispatch. They were escorted by about fifty Fingoe
Levies, armed as usual, with guns and assegais; their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
felt hats ornamented with the feathers of the Kaffir
crane, the ostrich, vink, and lorie, jackall's brushes,
or strips of tiger skin; and wearing suspended from
the waist by steel chains of their own manufacture,
bags or purses, called <i>daghasacs</i>, ingeniously made
without a seam, of the entire skin of the wild cat, dossie,
or monkey (the opening at the neck being the only
one, through which the whole of the flesh and bone
is removed); in these they carry their pipes and
tobacco, the <i>iquaka</i> or snuff box (made of a small
gourd, with bead ornaments, and horn or metal spoons
attached, similar to those in use in the Highlands);
with their flint and steel, charms, and other odds and
ends.</p>

<p>Thus relieved, the oxen jogged cheerily on, and the
march was prolonged several hours beyond our usual
distance. At sunset, on leading our horses to drink
at a small vley, near the edge of the bush, we found
the fresh spoor of a tiger, the prints of his massive
feet being quite plain in the mud. After nightfall
we crept more slowly on; the waggons jolting and
creaking heavily along the rough road, bumping up
against the huge stones, and diving into the deep
gullies, or "sluits," with which it abounded. At last
we halted, and groping about in the dark, tumbling
into jackall's holes and running into prickly bushes,
managed to pitch our tents on the worst piece of
ground imaginable; and, as it was out of the question
to find wood, we gave up the idea of fires; though
it had already begun to rain; and turned in, hoping
to sleep soundly after a thirty miles march. In this
we were however disappointed, for a great number of
the tents blew down during the night, in a high wind,
that tore up the tent pegs from the soft ground, and
left us exposed to the pitiless pelting of the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>But all things have an end, and next morning the
sun shone out as brightly as ever; and the face of the
country looked fresher and greener than before. Our
road led for some miles through a fine <i>poort</i>, or glen;
shut in by high bold rocky hills, with prickly-pear,
scarlet and lilac geraniums, and African aloes in full
flower, growing in every nook and crevice; the steep
road winding by the course of a mountain stream,
along which grew hundreds of the large white arum,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
orange-coloured salvias, and a host of other flowers;
whilst chattering flocks of the bright golden green
spreuw,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> honey-birds and orioles flitted among the
tall jungle, and flew from branch to branch.</p>

<p>After toiling some hours up a steep and most
execrable road, we came in sight of Graham's Town,
with the size, situation, and general appearance of
which, we were somewhat disappointed. It is a
straggling place, situated in the midst of a bare piece
of country, surrounded by equally bare hills. We
marched through the town, to Fort England, and
pitched our tents on the turf-covered square, in front
of the officers' quarters&mdash;detached cottages, with small
gardens, enclosed by hedges of prickly-pear. Here
we remained two or three days, preparing for the
field, and awaiting orders from General Somerset, to
whose division we were attached. Our bonnets and
plaids were replaced by a costume more suitable for
the bush&mdash;viz., a short dark canvas blouse; in addition,
to which feldt-schoen, and lighter pouches, made
of untanned leather, were issued to the men, and broad
leather peaks fixed to their forage caps, forming as light
and serviceable a head-dress as possible. We further
provided ourselves with pack-horses, pack-saddles, patrol
tents, camp kettles, saddle-bags, black servants, and
a hundred other necessaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>On Monday morning, just as the waggons were
loaded, and we were on the point of marching out
of the place, an express arrived from the General,
countermanding the move, in consequence of information
he had received of an insurrection among the
Hottentots of Theopolis, a station of the London
Missionary Society, and the common focus of the
rebels of the district. About seventy Hottentots with
their wives and families resided there, and amongst
them several Fingoes. The former having been joined
the previous day by other rebels and Cape Corps
deserters, formed their plans and proceeded to carry
them into effect next morning at day-break, by murdering
in cold blood the loyal and unsuspecting Fingoes,
whom they shot down as they were leaving their huts.</p>

<p>To chastise and disperse these rebels and murderers
was the object of our suddenly altered destination;
and as they had taken up a strong position at Theopolis,
it was on that point the General now concentrated
all his available force. Two companies of the 74th
were ordered to parade immediately in light marching
order (<i>i. e.</i>, carrying their blankets on their backs, and
leaving their tents behind), and accompanied by guides,
the Albany Rangers and some Levies, marched at once
for the scene of action. We watched them ascending
the steep hills behind the barracks, until they were
lost to sight, and envied them coming in for active
duty. However, our time came sooner than we had
hoped, for as we sat at breakfast next morning in our
tents, a sudden order arrived for us to march in half-an-hour
to join the former patrol. Away went breakfast
things, and all was life. Knives and forks were
quickly succeeded by dirks and pistols; and officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and men were fully equipped before the appointed
time. After some delay in waiting for a six-pounder
field-piece, some artillerymen, and waggons of ammunition,
we marched away to the sound of the old
bagpipes, crossed the mountain, and descended by a
very steep road into a lovely little nook or basin at its
foot, where we halted to rest the oxen, after five miles
of very hard work; bivouacking on the grassy banks
of the Kowie, in a pretty spot glowing with African
aloes and salvias, and shut in by trees on every side
but the one by which we had approached, where the
mountain towered above us in all its beauty. Climbing
the opposite ascent, we pursued our way through bush
and plain for about twenty miles, halting, some time
after darkness had set in, on the edge of the Brak
River, where the troops were ordered to lie down for
a couple of hours' rest. Determining to make the
most of the time, I threw myself down at once in my
plaid, on the ground, under a snug bush, and endeavoured
to snatch a little slumber; but it was so bitterly
cold, and the jackalls howled in such melancholy tones,
that sleep was impossible for the first hour, and I
could hardly believe that my eyes had been closed
for more than five minutes, when awakened by the
orderly sergeant, shaking me by the shoulder to rise.</p>

<p>It was a pitch dark night, not a star to be seen,
and we marched on, stumbling against ant-hills, and
walking into deep holes of ant-bears<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> at almost every
step, accidents well known to all who have made night
marches in this country. At length we saw, at about
five miles distance, and right ahead of us, the glimmering
camp fires of the other part of our force, and
entered their lines at the first streak of dawn, astonishing
them not a little by our unexpected appearance. We
learned that a slight skirmish had taken place with
the rebels, from whom several waggons had been
taken. Field Cornet Grey had been killed, and
Commandants Woerst and Stults, with four others
of the Levies, wounded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>We remained here for the next twenty-four hours,
awaiting the cover of night to make our advance upon
the enemy's position, from which we were about twelve
miles distant. During the day, which was exceedingly
warm, we refreshed ourselves by bathing in a small
stream, and eating oranges in a grove close to the
camp; the trees of unusual size, covered with ripe
golden fruit, from their topmost branches, down to the
lowest boughs, which swept the ground from their
weight. Fine bananas grew among the trees, and a
profuse undergrowth of waving grass everywhere; the
place having been abandoned since the commencement
of the war.</p>

<p>Late in the day the General arrived in camp with an
escort of Cape Mounted Rifles, making our force about
six hundred and forty men, with eight artillerymen and
a field-piece. The troops were ordered to lie down
to rest at an early hour, as we were to move off to
the scene of attack soon after midnight; when all
were to fall in quickly and quietly, and without giving
any unnecessary indication of our movement. About
half-past one o'clock we were turned out; and, with
a strange feeling of excitement, heightened by the
novelty of our silent movements, the subdued voices
of officers and orderly sergeants, indistinctly seen
through the gloom gliding along the motionless ranks,
I took my place.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we moved off; the cavalry remaining
behind for a couple of hours. The road we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
had to traverse was most difficult, abounding for the
first few miles in deep holes and innumerable ant-hills;
after which, it became, if possible, worse; entering
a narrow rugged descending defile, a succession of
deep steps or ledges cut through a thick bush, and
intersected by sluits or dry watercourses (large and
deep enough, as we very soon found, to contain three
or four men at once), and thickly strewn with large
stones and loose rocks, over which we stumbled and fell
at almost every step, five or six being frequently down
at once, and often sustaining severe cuts and bruises.</p>

<p>The General, accompanied by the cavalry, came
up just as we were descending a very steep path,
down to the drift over the Kareiga, and passing us,
moved on to the front. At this point, unfortunately,
the forces got separated in the darkness of the night,
and being unacquainted with the country, one company
was completely lost in the bush; while another
wandered so far out of the way as to cause great
delay in commencing operations. We approached the
enemy's position just as the day began to dawn, and
found our advance retarded by a large barricade of
newly felled trees, thrown across the narrow path at
a point where the bush on either hand was perfectly
impenetrable. This obstruction again delayed us a
considerable time, as all were obliged to file through
an opening cut through the close thorny bushes; but
we got over the difficulty much more easily than was
expected, and in a few minutes were formed in order for
the attack, at the entrance of a fine grassy plain, perfectly
circular, probably three quarters of a mile in diameter,
and entirely encompassed by a belt of bush about three
miles in breadth all round.</p>

<p>It had been originally intended to place the mounted
force in position behind a stockade which they were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
reach by riding noiselessly along the inner margin of
the bush; but as day was approaching there was every
chance of their being discovered, consequently the plan
was abandoned, and they remained with the infantry,
which at once entered the enclosed plain by a narrow
road, and on gaining the open space took "skirmishing
order;" two companies extended, two in support, and
the remainder in reserve. The Cape Corps and mounted
burghers were formed on the extreme right of the
skirmishers, and we advanced rapidly across the plain
towards the enemy's huts, in rear of which, and under
cover of the bush, the Fingoe levies had been previously
placed in ambuscade.</p>

<p>As we advanced hundreds of quail rose so temptingly,
that notwithstanding our momentary expectation of
meeting very different game, we were unable to refrain
from exclamations, or to resist bringing up our rifles and
indulging in imaginary shots, until a few real ones from
the enemy quickly reminded us of the more serious
business of the day. A small party of the rebels had
suddenly made their appearance from a "vley" in front
of our right wing, and were immediately engaged with
the cavalry, some sharp firing taking place on both sides.
The skirmishers were at once moved forward to cover
them; and the next moment we found ourselves under
fire for the first time, wondering that so many balls
whistled around us, without hitting any one. On seeing
our advance the rebels took to flight and made for the
bush, closely pursued by the cavalry, but escaped down
a wooded kloof, from whence for a time they attempted
to keep up a scattering fire, occasionally appearing outside
the cover to take a surer aim, and again dodging
quickly behind the bushes to load, not always however
sufficiently so, for our keen marksmen brought down
several of them, and wounded others, which, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
assistance of one or two well directed vollies, had the
effect of completely silencing their fire in that quarter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we were approaching the huts on our left;
and seeing that their commander (a deserter, by the
way, from the Cape Corps, affecting the importance of a
British officer, and issuing his written orders in due
form), had drawn up his men in line fronting the huts
with the evident intention of contesting the ground,
we rapidly "changed direction" to that flank, the
skirmishers wheeling to the left in double-quick time,
and the cavalry bringing their right shoulders forward
and charging towards them at full gallop. The rebels
became panic stricken, fired a few random shots, killing
one of the Levies, and fled to that part of the bush where
our Fingoe and Bechuana allies were posted, from whom
they received, to their equal surprise and dismay, a
volley that killed seven or eight of their number, and
drove the rest back into the open space, whence they
escaped by the very outlet which was to have been held
by the mounted force. Had it been so occupied scarcely
a man would have escaped them. As it was, the dense
and extensive bush rendered all pursuit hopeless. We
therefore turned our attention to the capture of their ill-gotten
spoil, taking 632 head of fine cattle, some horses
and goats, all stolen from the neighbouring settlers,
besides a large quantity of grain, and six waggons. The
huts were well stocked with clothes, cooking utensils,
native ornaments, and furniture, including the recognised
property of the murdered Fingoes; these dwellings set on
fire were speedily roaring and crackling like furnaces.
In several were dogs that had been hit by our fire, and
in one hut the exasperated Fingoes had found a wounded
Hottentot left behind by his people. He prayed hard
for mercy, but in vain, for one of them, whom the cruel
massacre had deprived of a parent, blew out his brains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
before any one could interfere, exclaiming: "Wena!
uyabulala ubawo bam!" (You! murderer of my father!)</p>

<p>While searching about the place a shot was fired at us
by some fellow skulking in the bush, to the edge of
which we had incautiously wandered. Gordon had a
narrow escape, as the ball ploughed up the ground at
his feet, and covered him with the soil. The Fingoes
immediately dashed in, in pursuit, making the wood ring
with their yells.</p>

<p>From the elevated site of the smouldering village we
had a fine and unexpected view of the sea at only a
few miles distance, the intervening country, grassy and
well wooded, being intersected by the winding Kareiga.
We bivouacked for breakfast, boiling our coffee on the
embers of the huts, and spreading our rations of beef
and black biscuit on the trampled grass, not many
yards from the corpses of those who had fallen. A few
stray Kaffirs were espied stealing away through the
open bush in the valley below, and though far out of
range, set all the Fingoes firing away at once in the
wildest manner imaginable.</p>

<p>After resting for about half an hour we returned by
the road we had traversed the night before, which was,
of course, up-hill all the way back. It was now intensely
hot; and after having marched thirty-five miles the previous
day, and been on foot two nights successively,
we found it heavy work, nearly all being half asleep as
we staggered along the burning road. I found myself
several times in a state of somnambulism, starting out of
sleep as I stumbled over the inequalities of the ground,
wondering for the instant where I was. Thus we plodded
on till late in the evening, when jaded and weary we
again reached the bivouac left eighteen hours before,
during seventeen of which we had never rested. The
steady and soldier-like manner in which the men performed
this march, so soon after landing from a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sea voyage, deservedly elicited the commendations of
the General in Orders. It was with a feeling of relief
and pleasure, known only to those who have undergone
the excessive fatigues of such a forced march, that we
threw ourselves down to rest, and kicked the shoes off
our burning feet.</p>

<p>It was late the following afternoon when we again
halted at the Kowie River, at the foot of the mountain,
and the oxen being too much exhausted to drag the
waggons up, we encamped there for the night. Having
neither bread nor biscuit left, we made a supper of beef
and cold water, refreshing ourselves, after sleeping three
nights in our clothes, by a moonlight bathe in the cold
stream. Next morning all were under way at three
o'clock, and before day dawned were near the top of
the mountain road looking down on the fires we had
left, glimmering far below in the yet dark valley. The
camp at Fort England was reached in time for a
somewhat late breakfast, during which we had more
than enough to do between satisfying our own voracious
appetites and the eager inquiries of those who had so
unwillingly been left behind.</p>

<p>General Somerset, on his return to Graham's Town,
received despatches from the Commander-in-chief of
such a nature as to induce him to march us at once up
the country to Fort Hare. Accordingly we struck tents
next morning, though it was Sunday, and proceeded to
Bothas Hill that afternoon, whence we had our first
view of the lofty rugged chain of the Amatolas, gazing
upon them in the blue distance, with no little interest, as
our reported destination, and feeling that at last we were
fairly off for Kaffirland. The view from this hill was
splendid: endless chains of mountains; dark and wooded
kloofs; sunny valleys, and grassy plains, dotted with
mimosa; all clad in a depth and variety of colouring
forming a picture as difficult to describe as to forget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The following morning we entered the Ecca Pass, the
terror of waggon-drivers and "post-riders," and notorious
as the scene of many fatal ambuscades. The road
winds along a deep narrow valley between high hills
covered with dense thorny bush, and has a high wall of
rock on the one hand, on the other a precipitous ravine,
with admirable cover for Kaffirs everywhere, and is,
perhaps, one of the most villanous specimens of a high
road in the known world, abounding throughout its
entire length with rocks of all sizes, from that of a
"company's arm-chest" downwards; holes in the middle
of it as deep as an ordinary horse-pond. On the one
side the yawning precipices encroach on the crumbling
path; while on the other some communicative driver
points to overhanging crags and unapproachable cliffs,
from which unsuspecting escorts and parties of horsemen
are frequently fired upon by lurking bands of the enemy;
with what fatal effect is evidenced by the bones and
dried up hides of oxen and horses lying in the track. At
a turn in the road, where only three days before a
mounted express had been attacked, and four of the
party wounded, we disturbed a troop of gorged vultures,
which, rising from the half-devoured carcase of one of
the horses, alighted on the rocks above, from the concealed
crevices of which the rebels had taken aim.
Within three weeks after this attack they again waylaid
a like party, but with more fatal effect, two men being
killed and four wounded. We were suffered to pass
without molestation. The appearance of our long line,
as it moved down the valley, was very striking; wild-looking
Fingoes, strings of oxen and waggons, the glittering
forest of bayonets, straggling Levies, pack-horses,
and camp followers, winding along the hill-side, through
the glowing bush, which was varied by magnificent
euphorbias, rivalling forest trees in height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the rocks were numbers of dossies<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> (a sort of
rabbit, with a rat's head and monkey's hands) and some
large baboons.</p>

<p>We emerged from the valley by a steep rough road,
called Brak River Hill, and after a few miles level trek
through a sandy country, sprinkled with thorn bushes,
arrived at Fort Brown, a lonely quadrangular fortification,
close to the Great Fish River, on the opposite bank of
which we encamped for the night.</p>

<p>At the Koonap River, where we outspanned for a
couple of hours next morning, two magnificent koodoo
were seen, but they disappeared in the thick bush before
any of the stalkers were within rifle range; one of them
was a splendid fellow, as large as a mule, with long upright
spiral horns, full three feet high.</p>

<p>From this the road for some distance ran along the
base of a lofty range of cliffs called the Blue Krantz, an
unbroken precipice of grey rock, at least 100 feet in
height, and so perpendicular that a stone thrown from
it would have fallen right among us; its summit fringed
with aloes and overhanging trees, scarlet geranium
springing from every crevice.</p>

<p>After crossing the river by two deep drifts, a few hundred
yards apart, the diverging roads re-united at a deserted
military post, destroyed by the enemy, and we commenced
the ascent of the Koonap Hill, a long winding
steep road, strewed, like the pass of the previous day,
with the bones and carcasses of horses and bullocks,
victims, not of savages, but of civilized cruelty; in our
own case, one after another, twenty-one oxen were left
dying or perfectly exhausted on the hill-side, and it was
with the greatest difficulty that the remainder, weakened
by long scarcity of pasture, were goaded to the top, though
each waggon was drawn up by a double span, or team,
driven by four or five screaming swearing Totties, who,
besides their terrific whips, every cut of which left a long
bare bleeding streak, used a heavy "jambok" of rhinoceros
hide, six feet long, and as thick as a man's wrist at the
handle, and at every stand-still, when these failed, bent
the unfortunate animals' tails till they broke, biting
them savagely.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>The extensive range of country seen from this hill
increased in beauty as we ascended the road which ran
along the edge of the ravine, fringed with majestic
euphorbias; in the distance deep blue mountains, and
plains of red sand, then wavy bush-covered hills, and in
the valley below us the winding river, and our rear
guard, with their long line of waggons slowly advancing.</p>

<p>It was not till the afternoon that the last waggon
reached the top of the ascent. No longer shaded by
high wooded banks, we found the sun oppressively hot
as we trekked along through endless clumps of dusty
spek-boom, or elephant tree. In the evening we had a
magnificent sunset view of the Amatolas; and just as
night set in came to a halt (after a march of about two
and twenty miles) at Lieuw Fontein (lion's spring),
close to a small military post standing alone in a desolate
country, and garrisoned by some Hottentot Levies,
under an officer of the line, who must have had a lively
time of it, as no one dare go beyond the gates, except
with a strong mounted escort.</p>

<p>Orders were issued to march at eight next morning,
a most gentlemanly hour, as all agreed, and the
more cordially as the distance to be performed was
only six miles, to the Kat River, to pasture the oxen,
which now absolutely required rest and food. They
were turned out to graze under the protection of a
subaltern's guard, while we hastened to purify ourselves
in the rocky stream, protected by an armed party on
the willow banks; for some dozen Kaffirs in red blankets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
were seen on a low hill about a mile off, their attention
apparently divided equally between the herds and the
bathers.</p>

<p>After this welcome rest we resumed our march next
morning, but before many miles were accomplished, the
waggons in front came to a stand-still at the foot of a
steep short hill. Judging from its apparently moderate
height we thought the stoppage would only be brief,
but to our surprise, soon observed the more knowing
drivers in rear of the train begin to make deliberate preparation
for breakfast, those nearer the front contenting
themselves with a biscuit. Fires were made, coffee
pounded, dirty bags rummaged, and lumps of raw meat
drawn out, studded with copper caps and bits of broken
pipe, and plentifully dusted with crumbs and powdered
biscuit; and they were soon at work, tooth and nail.
As for the troops, no orders having been given for
breakfast, from the uncertainty of our movements, we
went without.</p>

<p>The last forelouper had finished his scanty pickings
and wiped the greasy clasped-knife on his woolly pate,
the drivers had smoked out a digestive pipe, and were
fast asleep under their waggons, before the "fall in"
sounded, and we moved forward. We had wondered at
the long delay, but were more astonished, when we came
to the ascent, that it had ever been accomplished with
such heavily laden waggons.</p>

<p>This achieved, the road was tolerably level, and we
jogged on at a good pace to a ruined and deserted missionary
settlement, where we were again brought to a
stand by the breaking down of a waggon in the middle
of a drift. There was nothing for it but to unload and
carry everything to the opposite bank, when officers and
men set to and spoked it out, inch by inch; the driver,
meanwhile, manufacturing a new "dissel-boom" or pole
out of a young tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>On approaching Fort Hare, we were met by a large
mounted party of officers who had come out to welcome
us, and shortly the place came in sight, which appeared,
from the hill, of considerable size, consisting of white
wooden houses, and dark Fingoe huts, widely scattered
round the fort. Though covering a large extent of
ground, the works hardly deserve the name, being in
reality nothing more than a small village of thatched
mud cottages, enclosed by picketting and low walls
mounting a few guns and old musquetoons.</p>

<p>Our arrival was greeted with lively demonstrations of
joy by the coloured population, who headed the band,
yelling and dancing in a state of complete nudity. Our
camp, with two others consisting of Europeans and
Fingoe Levies, was on a green level plain, between the
fort and the River Chumie, beyond which rose a fine
range of lofty mountains.</p>

<p>Anything more miserable in the shape of barrack accommodation
than the officers' quarters in the fort can
hardly be conceived; uneven floors of dried cow-dung,
bending walls of "wattle and daub," smoke-blackened
rafters and thatch, crazy doors, and ill-fitting windows,
which exclude the light and admit in turn, wind, rain,
and clouds of sand, are the characteristics of the
best.</p>

<p>We took advantage of our stay here to ride over in a
party to the scene of the engagement mentioned, which
took place on the 29th December, in attempting to open
a communication with the Governor, then blockaded
in Fort Cox; when out of a band of only 230 men,
after a hand-to-hand fight, two gallant officers, Lieutenants
Melvin and Gordon, 91st regiment, and twenty-one
privates, were killed, and many wounded. The
ground, a thorny valley, still bore marks of the
struggle: rags of uniform, and old forage-caps, with
bones of Kaffirs, lay scattered about; while from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
grave of the soldiers, bones were protruding, scratched
up by jackalls and hyænas, which we carefully buried
again in the best way we could.</p>

<p>About thirty Kaffir and Hottentot prisoners were confined
in the fort, who sat, for the greatest part of the
day, sunning themselves outside the cells, hand-cuffed,
and chained two and two. The Hottentots, who had
been taken at the capture of Fort Armstrong, and were
awaiting their trial by court-martial as rebels, looked
sulky, and scowled with a vindictive and villanous
expression. The Kaffirs, on the contrary, laughed and
chatted with us, through an interpreter, displaying the
most magnificent teeth,&mdash;a feature common, also, to the
Fingoes, and of which both are not a little proud. A
fine young Fingoe was pointed out to us among the
Levies, who, having had a front tooth accidentally
knocked out, got it replaced by an artificial one, for
which he willingly paid five-and-twenty shillings.</p>

<p>The resemblance between these two races is such as
to make it difficult, except to those who have lived long
among them, to tell one from the other. In complexion
they are identical, speak the same language; both alike
are tall and well made: their women, well proportioned
and exceedingly graceful in carriage; to which may be
added the similarity of national dress&mdash;viz., a kaross of
the skins of wild beasts, a bull's hide, or a loose blanket,
with earrings and necklaces of tiger's teeth, shells, or
seeds; while anklets and armlets of black and white
beads, tastefully worked, are worn by the women, with
smooth, brightly polished brass rings reaching from the
wrist to the elbow, gradually increasing in size.</p>

<p>The Hottentots differ in every respect from both,
being very short and slightly made, lean, and with ugly
yellow monkey-looking faces, very prominent cheek
bones, small turned-up snub noses, and little twinkling
cunning eyes, and invariably wearing European garments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
though in modesty the naked Fingoe and Kaffir
immeasurably surpass them.</p>

<p>Just as the regiment was assembling for service in the
centre of the camp, on Sunday morning, we were startled
by hideous yelling and cries from the Fingoe camp,
whereby the service was delayed for some time. For
seeing the Commandant of the garrison galloping over,
followed by other officers, one and all bolted after them
to see what was going on, and found the Fingoes fighting
about the division of rations. There were several
hundreds of them struggling like demons, in clouds of
dust, yelling out their war-cry, and challenging each
other. All were perfectly naked, the blood running
down the black faces and breasts of many from the
blows of "knobkerries," or clubs, which they applied to
each other's heads with such astounding force that the
very report was enough to give one a headache. Not
satisfied with this, some seizing their assegais, rushed
furiously into the crowd, yelling savagely, and stabbing
right and left. It was with the greatest difficulty, on
the part of the Commandant and the officers of the
Levies, backed by the efforts of the native sergeants, that
the Fingoes were at length quieted, and dispersed.
Most of them were more or less marked with the fray,
and several had received severe assegai wounds, to
which, however, they appeared perfectly indifferent, for,
twisting up a tuft of dry grass into a small plug, and
stuffing it into the gash, they lighted their wooden pipes,
and smoked away as if nothing particular had happened.</p>

<p>General Somerset arrived, and we received orders
to prepare for the march on the morrow, on our way
to the famed Amatolas, the Gibraltar of the Gaikas,
and head-quarters of Sandilli, who was said to be
strongly posted in their almost impregnable fastnesses.
Commissariat and baggage-waggons kept pouring into
camp all day long; arms were cleaned and examined;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
saddle-bags and pack-saddles, patrol-tents and cooking
utensils overhauled and fitted; and all was bustle and
preparation. The patrol-tent, by the way, is a canvas
affair, about six feet long and three feet high, not much
unlike a dog kennel, into which the owner creeps on
hands and knees, and is supported by a couple of poles
of about four feet high, steadied by guys and pegs,
and folds up into a small enough compass to be carried
under the arm, though it is generally stowed away
on the pack-saddle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
ADVANCE INTO KAFFIRLAND&mdash;ATTACK ON THE AMATOLAS&mdash;FORT BEAUFORT&mdash;CAMP
ON THE KOONAP RIVER.</h2>


<p>Early on the morning of the 24th June, tents were
once more struck, baggage packed, and the long train
of waggons stood ready inspanned.</p>

<p>The General, with his Staff, appeared on the
ground, where the whole division, amounting to 2000
men, artillery, cavalry, infantry and irregulars, stood
drawn up in column; the advance and rear guards
were formed; and we moved off to the inspiriting air
of "Hieland Laddie," from the 74th band, which
accompanied us, at the head of the column, for about
a mile; when, halting by the road side (as it had to
remain at Fort Hare,) the quickstep changed into the
farewell melody of "Auld lang syne," as the long
waving line of hardy sun-burnt troops marched steadily
past in column of sections; not ceasing till all were
hidden from sight in the cloud of dust that floated
along the side of the hill called "Sandilli's Kop."
The pipers then struck up "Over the Border," and
played us across the frontier, into Kaffirland, through
the whole of which the "pipes" afterwards accompanied
us, inspiriting the men on many a long and weary
march, and enlivening our camps with the familiar
strains of the "auld country."</p>

<p>Our way lay through level grassy plains along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
base of the Little Amatolas, whose sloping verdant
sides were beautifully relieved by fine bold crags and
perpendicular krantzes, or cliffs, of grey basaltic rock,
and varied by deep belts of wood, marking the course
of some invisible mountain stream. On these plains,
the advance cavalry patrol, about a quarter of a mile
ahead, fell in with some Kaffirs, with whom we saw
them exchanging shots among the scattered bushes;
and being ignorant of their numbers, began to feel
excited, as a troop of horse, detached from the main
body, gallopped forward to reconnoitre, or render
assistance if needed. It proved to be a marauding
party who had been surprised returning with stolen
cattle, to one of their villages which we saw a little
way up the side of the mountain, and on coming up
we found they had recaptured forty head of cattle,
and killed three Kaffirs. The corpse of one lay close
to the track, his hand still clutching a bundle of
assegais. A mounted party was sent to set fire to
the village, where they found only a Gaika woman;
the rest of the inhabitants having fled to the fastnesses
above on the first alarm of our approach. Hundreds
of Kaffirs were moving along the summit of the lofty
heights on the right, watching our movements below;
their figures appearing like specks against the clear
blue sky.</p>

<p>A few miles more brought us at last to a halt on the
Amatola Flats; where, after a continued march of
above 250 miles, we pitched tents by the banks of the
Quesana River, at the foot of the Great Amatolas.
The sun sank behind the purple mountains in a flood
of crimson; and as the darkness gathered around,
and troops of wolves and jackals commenced their
nightly howling, the flames of the burning village grew
brighter and more distinct on the dark hill side. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
heat of the day was succeeded, as usual, by a cold
sharp air, and the cheerful camp-fires were quickly
surrounded by men and officers; some in blanket-coats
and pea-jackets, squatting cross-legged around
a steaming camp-kettle; others in the midst of
culinary cares, chopping wood, replenishing the fire,
or lifting the pot lid to taste the soup; while those
who had already dined, were enjoying their pipes.
Our evenings in camp were occasionally varied, either
by a round of large parties, when each guest invited
brought with him his own "tin-tot," knife, spoon,
and biscuit; or by musical soirées in our tents; where,
with a guttering tallow candle fixed in the socket
of a bayonet stuck in the ground, we sipped thick
coffee and sang duets and solos with very loud
choruses till a late hour, and generally with more
satisfaction to ourselves than our neighbours.</p>

<p>The following forenoon several Kaffirs were killed in
a skirmish with the Cape Corps, and their huts burnt
and destroyed. The expected order was issued for the
attack next day, and the division directed to be under
arms at five o'clock in the morning, "to turn out without
bugle sound, or any noise whatever." A camp-guard of
300 men was to be left behind under a captain; and,
lastly, all lights and fires in the camp were ordered to
be extinguished at seven o'clock. Till then we sat discussing
the anticipated attack, when the curfew put an
end to our councils, we groped our way to the dark
tents, and lay down to rest in our clothes.</p>

<p>It was still quite dark when my servant shook me by
the shoulder, and with some difficulty succeeded in
making me comprehend that the troops were already
"falling in," and that he wanted to pack up the blanket
and plaid on which I lay. Accordingly I jumped up,
and after loading the pack-horse with three days' rations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
patrol-tent, kettles, and other requisites for the bivouac,
we made our way, stumbling along in the dark, over
tent-ropes and picketing pegs, to the parade-ground,
where the first brigade was rapidly assembling. The
motionless ranks were inspected as far as the imperfect
light allowed, and all in silence; and at five o'clock precisely,
the General having arrived on the ground, the
word of command was passed on <i>sotto voce</i>, and we
moved noiselessly away to the foot of the mountains,
commencing the ascent of the Western Amatolas by
the pass in front of our encampment, reaching the summit
just at day-break.</p>

<p>Here we were halted in line along the ridge, while
General Somerset proceeded with a detachment of the
Cape Corps to reconnoitre the position of the enemy on
the Victoria heights on our right flank. On reaching
the southern point of the range his party was sharply
attacked, and a brisk skirmish maintained for a time on
both sides. Moving forward a column of two companies
of the 91st, and three of European and native Levies,
under command of Lieut.-Col. Sutton, the General returned
to our brigade to direct the movements of the
main attack.</p>

<p>We saw the smoke of the enemy's fires curling slowly
up from the dark bush, on a steppe or lower ridge of the
elevated range in front, and on the opposite side of a
lovely valley which lay at our very feet, carpeted with
the smoothest and greenest grass, and dotted with mimosa,
protéa, and clumps of tangled bush. On our left
towered the lofty peak of the Hogsback, the highest
point of the whole chain; and below it lay a finely
wooded deep ravine, down the centre of which foamed a
milk-white cataract, the dark forest stretching away on
either side, and filling the kloof.</p>

<p>In a few moments an aid-de-camp rode up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
instructions for our brigade to move forward and descend
into the valley below; the cavalry and pack-horses
making a detour of about a mile to our left, to a
point where the descent was somewhat less precipitous.
After scrambling down to the bottom, we formed "column
of sub-divisions," and moved across the valley, perceiving
as we neared the lofty bridge opposite several hundreds
of the enemy gathering on its summit, their arms
flashing and glittering along the edge of the cliff in the
morning sun. There was only one point at which this
apparently impregnable position was accessible, and that
was by a long steep exposed grassy ridge, destitute of
all cover, and completely commanded from the top by a
perfect fortification of huge detached rocks, behind which
we could perceive the enemy strongly posted and quietly
waiting our attack, confident in the security of their position.
Up this formidable ascent, bare and slippery as
the roof of a house, the 74th were ordered to advance
and storm the natural citadel at its summit. In the
meantime heavy firing, about a mile distant on our
right, announced that Col. Sutton's column was engaged
with the enemy in that direction; while the different
corps of native Levies were moved round to our right and
left flanks, those on the left skirmishing through the
bush and setting fire to a number of Kaffir huts. Pushing
rapidly on to the point of attack, we waded the
river, and commenced the arduous ascent, up which, in
spite of a burning sun, the men mounted like true
Highlanders. To our surprise the enemy allowed us
to come considerably within range, and we were beginning
to imagine the position was abandoned, when suddenly
they opened fire upon us from the shelter of the
crags, sweeping every inch of the smooth approach,
themselves invisible, the tops only of their black heads
peeping over the rocks as they took aim, and disappearing
again as instantaneously as the flash of their guns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Showers of balls whistled past us, with the peculiar
<i>ping, whit</i>, so well known to those who have been under
fire; as we mounted, we returned their fire with steady
well-directed volleys every time their heads were seen
above the parapet of rocks, and deployed into line
under a rattling fire, and the fight begun in earnest. A
private fell shot in the foot. For a quarter of an hour
there was an incessant roar of musketry and whistling
of bullets. As we neared the top, scrambling with hands
and knees up the crags, which were now discovered to
be of enormous size, and in places insurmountable;
the fire became hotter, the balls striking the ground
and sending the earth and gravel flying in our faces.
One man fell shot through the arm and side; I passed
another sitting on the ground wounded in several
places, and two more awaiting the surgeon's aid; one
with a shattered hand and the other a wound in the
head, his face deluged with blood. Lieutenant Bruce
received a shot in the arm, and a sixth man fell badly
wounded in the leg.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>74<sup>TH</sup> HIGHLANDERS STORMING THE AMATOLAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The men's mess-tins and folded coats were grazed and
torn on every side, and their firelocks shattered in their
hands; in one or two instances the barrels were perforated
as though they had been soft lead.</p>

<p>Under this fire we sent out two companies in skirmishing
order, and climbing from rock to rock,
exchanging shots with the enemy at close quarters,
crowned the ridge with a cheer, and carried the position,
driving off the defenders, who took refuge in a dense
forest a few hundred yards in the rear. We now stood
in their fortress, which was scattered with remains of
roasted marrow bones and torn cartridge covers, the
rocks stained with fresh blood. We were astonished
at the strength of the position, which might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
held by a hundred regular troops against such a force
as ours, with great loss to the assailants. Towards this
forest (of fine timber, the first we had seen in the
country), we quickly advanced across the intervening
belt of turf-covered table-land. Here again they had
the advantage of position; for unseen themselves, they
opened a severe fire on us, killing one of our non-commissioned
officers at the first volley, the ball passing
right through his heart. Our Colonel and the Major
very narrowly escaped, a bullet cutting through the
clothes of the former by the waist; while the Major's
haversac was shot through. Two more men fell wounded,
and another, shot through the brain, dropped dead
without a groan. The word <i>forward</i> was given by our
gallant Colonel, who himself set the example, and we
dashed into the wood under a rattling fire, and gave
them another volley, which must have told severely;
for though they always carry off their dead and wounded
to prevent their casualties being known, we found as
we advanced the bodies of five lying dead in one
place, and twelve in another; and as we plunged after
them into the tangled forest, the <i>blood-spoor</i> showed
where others had fallen. The change was so great from
the glare of the sunshine to the gloom of the forest,
its thick foliage overhead interwoven with <i>baboon-ropes</i>
and creepers, that we could hardly distinguish our
enemies as they darted swiftly from cover to cover.
Five rebel Hottentots were killed in a hole or pit half-hidden
by bush. Another of our men was shot dead
by a Kaffir perched in the thick branches of a lofty tree,
from which he was brought down, riddled with balls,
the body tumbling with a crash into the thicket
beneath. A cluster of Kaffir and "hartebeest" or
Hottentot huts (the former shaped like a huge bee-hive,
the latter like a patrol-tent) was set fire to, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
its being known, till half consumed, that they contained
a number of wounded Kaffirs.</p>

<p>We continued skirmishing as they retired before
us, dodging from tree to rock, and from rock to bush,
taking advantage of every cover to give us a shot, while
we kept up an incessant "independent-file-firing," as
they retreated, step by step, till lost in thickets, impervious
to anything but wild beasts or Kaffirs. Having
driven them into their inaccessible retreats among the
extensive forests clothing the higher steppes of the
mountain, and inflicted a considerable loss upon them,
we skirmished through a belt of wood on our right, and
after completely scouring it debouched on an <i>open</i>,
where we halted in column, and for the first time for
nine hours sat down to rest our weary limbs. Here we
assisted the surgeon in performing different operations
on the wounded, whose cries for water were so constant,
that our canteens were soon left without a drop to
moisten our own lips, parched and blistered by the sun.</p>

<p>It was now two o'clock, and as not one of us had yet
broken his fast, it may easily be imagined with what
appetite we gnawed at our black biscuit. While thus
engaged the enemy was observed stealing out, one by
one, from the forest, and collecting on the open table-land,
where our gallant fellows lay dead; and to our
indignation we saw them, through the telescope, stripping
the bodies, without our being able to prevent it, a
deep gorge separating us; a few well-directed conical
balls, from heavy metalled rifles by Egg and Purday,
dispersed them at a distance of three-quarters of a
mile; one was seen to fall. The party were rebel Hottentots
(Cape Corps deserters), and Kaffirs, the latter
perfectly naked, and armed with guns and assegais; two
or three we could distinguish wearing the kaross, with
head-dresses of feathers, from which fact, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
being the centre of divers knots, we concluded they
were chiefs and <i>headmen</i>, holding councils of war.</p>

<p>We were joined here by the General and the rest of
the forces, including Colonel Sutton's column, which had
successfully attacked the enemy on the Victoria Heights,
driving them from their position, and killing twenty, but
with a loss of three men killed and five wounded (two of
them mortally), and had burnt and destroyed two of
their villages, which we saw blazing away fiercely, and
sending up volumes of smoke on the Little Amatola
across the valley. During our brief rest the rebels sent
a messenger of truce to say they wished to surrender.
Lieut.-Col. Sutton, riding out by desire of the General,
held a parley with about fifty or sixty of them at the
edge of the wood. They stated that they wished to
leave their Kaffir allies, and requested a week to collect
their own people, when they would give themselves up.
But, as the General, of course, insisted on immediate
surrender, and granted only half an hour instead of a
week, they quickly disappeared into the forest, their
object having evidently been only to gain time.</p>

<p>Observing the enemy again assembling on their former
ground, the General ordered the 74th to return through
the forest once more. As we worked our difficult way
through the underwood, taking care not to lose sight of
our right and left files, we kept a sharp look out every
step of our way; for each thicket, hollow trunk, or
jackal's hole, tuft of grass, or lofty tree, may conceal
the stealthy Kaffir when least expected; in an instant
the silent forest is suddenly peopled with a legion of
naked savages, springing, as it were, out of the earth,
with a deadly volley from their unsuspected ambuscade.</p>

<p>We passed the dead body of one of our men stripped
naked, lying in the jungle with a ghastly wound in his
chest; but having orders to advance through the belt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and join the column on the other side, it was impossible
to stop to bury or remove it. When the column came
up, a grave was dug for the other men; and the Colonel,
on my reporting having seen the body, sent me back
with half a dozen men to bring it in. We had, therefore,
to retrace our steps about a quarter of a mile
through the forest, at the edge of which a guard was
placed to render us assistance if attacked. The magnificent
trees, and the fallen trunks in various stages of
decay, overgrown with creepers, or green with moss,
forcibly reminded one of the backwoods of Canada. We
proceeded in perfect silence, with arms ready at a
moment's warning, and again came up to the body.
The stems of two or three young trees, picked up by the
way, and tied together by wild vine, served as a stretcher,
on which we bore the body back, and without interruption,
nearly to the edge of the wood. As we stopped
at this point to change bearers, a sound like the sharp
crack of a dry stick was heard; but as we could see no
one, and a dead silence reigned around, we resumed our
burden, from whose reopened wound a pool of blood
had flowed where it had rested. We had just gained
the open ground, when suddenly along the face of the
wood there blazed a sharp fire of musketry, and the
enemy sprang from every bush; our comrades of the
extended company at the same moment briskly returning
their fire. The balls again whistled past us,
lodging in the trees with a sharp <i>thud</i>, or ploughing up
the ground. One of our men was severely wounded in
the knee, and died afterwards while undergoing amputation;
the rest plunged into the forest in pursuit of the
enemy, who left seven dead on the ground, carrying off
many more dead and wounded. This interruption passed,
we proceeded with the corpse to the grave, which the
men had dug in the soft soil with their hands, billhooks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and bayonets, where we buried it with the two other
bodies of the poor fellows who had fallen; and, having
filled up the grave, carefully sprinkled it with dead
leaves and sticks, a precaution which, as we afterwards
learned from a Kaffir prisoner, was of no avail, for the
crafty wretches soon found the spot, and dragging the
bodies out, exposed them, as they said white men ought
to be, "to the sun and the vulture."</p>

<p>We learned that whilst we were returning with the
dead body an armed party of Hottentots came up, and
sat down with Lieut. Gordon, who was posted with the
company extended along the edge of the forest, and
asked for bread and tobacco, stating themselves to belong
to one of our native Levies, at that time at no
great distance, and whom they strongly resembled in
dress. Among them was a man in the Cape Corps
uniform, who, when questioned as to his being on foot
and in the bush, said he belonged to "troop A, Captain
C&mdash;&mdash;'s" and had, with several others, been ordered to
dismount, and skirmish with the Levies, their horses
being done up. Strongly suspecting they were rebels,
but not liking to act on mere suspicion, Gordon went to
request the Colonel to see them; but the moment the
rascals saw them approaching the spot where they sat
talking to our men, they jumped to their feet, and just
as the Colonel shouted, "Shoot them down," fired a
random volley, followed so instantaneously by the fire
of the company that the two appeared as one report,
three of the rebels falling on the spot, beside those killed
and wounded at the moment we emerged from the wood.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the above attack, a combined
movement was effected by the 2nd division, under
Colonel Mackinnon, which was separated into two
columns; the first, under his own immediate command,
moving from the Quilliquilli along the left bank of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Keiskamma; and the second, under Lieut.-Col. Michell,
proceeding to the Keiskamma Hoek. In conjunction
with the operations of the two main divisions, the troops
from the garrison of Fort Cox, under the command of
Lieut.-Col. Cooper, harassed the enemy in the valleys of
the Keiskamma, thus "penetrating the mountains in
four columns, converging to a common centre upon the
principal strongholds of the enemy." A large native
force, under Captain Tylden, R.E., was also placed in
position on the Windogelberg, in order to prevent them
making for the country beyond the Kei.</p>

<p>It was now near dusk, and having been out since five
in the morning we were not sorry to hear the order to
return to camp. As we descended the steep pass, stormed
in the morning, the lines of camp-fires were seen blazing
cheerfully on the darkening plain below, where the rest
of the division was already bivouacked. Having again
forded the river, on approaching the lines, the officers
and men of the 91st came out to meet us. They had
got fires lighted, and wood and water ready for our
wearied men, and helping to carry in our wounded,
shared their coffee with us. Whilst sitting round the
fires we talked over the stirring events of the day,
lamenting the fate of the brave fellows who had
marched out with us that morning in as high health
and spirits as ourselves, and now lay in their lonely
graves on the heights above.</p>

<p>Shortly after nightfall it was discovered that there
was no water left in camp, and, being the orderly officer,
I was sent with an armed party to bring a supply from
the river, about a quarter of a mile from the sentries,
and (being thickly skirted with bush) a very likely
ambuscade for Kaffirs, who have a taste for lurking
round camps at night. We left the lines quietly, made
our way across the dark plain, and soon reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
river, which we heard, rather than saw, rushing along
between its shady banks. The water-party filled their
load of canteens without interruption, but the return to
camp, which on this side was occupied by the Levies,
was rather a hazardous affair, for the Fingoes have a
stupid way of firing first and challenging afterwards.
As a precautionary measure, therefore, before he could
see our approach, we commenced shouting "Friend!" to
the sentry who had passed us out, and also been specially
warned of our return; a bright flash was the immediate
answer, and a ball whizzed close over our heads: down
we all went flat on our faces, shouting "<i>Friend!</i>" more
lustily than before, as a second shot was fired at us; the
stir and jabber among the rest of the Fingoes, which
also prevented our being heard, promised a general sortie,
in which case we should be shot or assegaied to a
moral, so we took advantage of the sentry's reloading to
jump to our feet, and make a dash for it; to their great
astonishment, rushing almost into their arms, shouting
"Friend, friend, you scoundrels, friend!"</p>

<p>The wounded, who lay groaning all night by a fire
on the open field, suffered acutely from the cold;
their distressing cries, together with the unusual
hardness of the ground, kept us awake a great part of
the night.</p>

<p>We afterwards learned that the enemy's loss was
considerably greater than we had imagined, several
Chiefs were amongst the slain; Beta, and Pitoi Son-of-Vongya,
two of great note. Sandilli, who was
present, and directing the movements of his men, was
very nearly taken prisoner, escaping only by creeping
on his hands and knees through the thickest part of
the bush.</p>

<p>The morning after the fight rose dull and misty,
and the top of the mountain range was hidden by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
white fleecy clouds that rolled half-way down. Not
long after daylight a Gaika woman, with a child tied
on her back, approached the camp, and coolly walked
about among the tents and fires, looking for anything
she could appropriate.</p>

<p>The Kaffirs were heard on the heights, every word
distinctly audible, shouting to us, "<i>Nina Ez'innqulo!
yinina ukuba niyalusa pzu kwentaba enje izinqulala?</i>"
(Halloa, you Tortoises! why do you keep us up here
in the cold?) They distinguished the 74th by this
soubriquet, on account of a fancied resemblance between
the regimental tartan, and the chequered tortoises
that abound on their plains; it afterwards became
general among all the other tribes, and was not unfrequently
used by our own people.</p>

<p>After sending off our wounded in waggons, under
a cavalry escort, to the standing camp at Quesana,
we again ascended the same range, though at another
point, and by three different routes; the 91st and
native Levies by a pass about a mile to our right;
the cavalry by another, at some distance on our left;
ours, in the centre, though a somewhat shorter course,
was by far the steepest and most trying. The men,
loaded with their rations, blankets, great coats, firelocks,
and sixty rounds of ball cartridge, were so fatigued
under the overpowering heat of the noonday sun, that
the whole column constantly halted, literally unable
to move for the moment. During our ascent, the
enemy showed in small bodies on several points, but
did not attempt in any way to oppose us; and all three
columns met on the table land above, without having
fired a shot. After marching about seven miles further,
without seeing anything of the enemy, we descended
into the Zanooka valley, a beautiful green basin
completely surrounded by a splendid amphitheatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of high wooded mountains. The Fingoes plundered
a Kaffir village of considerable quantities of maize,
discovered buried in large circular holes, neatly plastered
over, in the floors of the huts, to which they afterwards
set fire. Here we bivouacked, while General Somerset,
taking with him the Cape Corps, and Hottentot and
Fingoe Levies, proceeded along the head of the Liguey
Stream; where, observing a party of the enemy posted
in the forest intersecting the ridge of Mount Macdonald,
he moved forward to attack them with the cavalry,
and after a brisk skirmish and heavy firing on both
sides, drove them back, and on the Levies coming
up completely routed them. Descending into the
valley of the Keiskamma, he returned, by a long
circuit, to the bivouac, about dusk, when the enemy
began to creep in nearer, and fire long shots at the
groups gathered round the blazing fires. A few bullets
dropped amongst us now and then; by one of which
a Levy officer was shot in the leg, as he was drinking
his coffee. At length, becoming bolder and more
troublesome, a party of skirmishers was sent out to
disperse them; and we sat watching the singular
conflict, of which nothing was visible but the two
long straggling broken lines of flashing musketry;
one retiring as the other advanced up the dark mountain
side. The beauty of the effect was heightened
by the prolonged rolling of the reports echoing among
the crags.</p>

<p>The whole column moved out of the basin shortly
after sunrise, and ascended Mount Macdonald, reaching
the summit at ten o'clock, where we halted; while
the corps of Levies were detached into the valley of
the Zanooka to intercept the enemy's cattle, the spoor
of which was traced in that direction. Small parties
of Kaffirs were observed at some distance descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
by different paths, into the valley of the Keiskamma,
and the bivouac we had just left was soon covered
with their dusky figures. The view from this elevation
was most beautiful, comprising the whole of the Zanooka
valley with its dark and extensive forests, sheltered
glens, and smooth grassy slopes, through which wound
the Tsimuka, now roaring along, foaming among
masses of red rock, then lost among the overhanging
trees to appear again between smooth and verdant
banks, dancing and glittering in the dazzling sunshine.</p>

<p>The standing camp of the 2nd Division was clearly
visible on a large plain about ten miles off: the troops
were patrolling in the wooded valleys between us, and
in communication with the General.</p>

<p>After completely scouring the bush at our feet, the
Levies passed down the valley, skirmishing with
scattered parties of rebels, and setting fire to their
huts; finally returning under cover of the Cape Corps,
which occupied the heights above under the immediate
command of the General, with three hundred and fifty
head of cattle, which we escorted along the ridges to
our former bivouac of the 26th in the Amatola valley;
leaving two companies of the 91st regiment to cover
the return of the Levies. This they effected leisurely
and without molestation, till the top of the pass was
gained, leading down to the plain on which we were
already bivouacked; when, just as it was growing dusk,
they were attacked in the rear by a few straggling
Kaffirs, who, taking advantage of the bush which
commanded the pass, opened a dropping fire upon
them, severely wounding the Captain of the Levies
in the arm, which was afterwards amputated. The
91st fired a volley into their cover, which silenced
them for a few minutes; but the Levies, exasperated
by the wounding of their officer, kept up an incessant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
roll of musketry in spite of our bugles; which, in front
of the General's patrol-tent, sounded the "cease firing"
for full ten minutes. As the darkness increased the
combatants were gradually lost to sight, and the flashing
of their muskets grew brighter, but less frequent, till
they ceased altogether. The wounded man, Captain
Melville, was shortly after borne into the camp on a
stretcher by the Fingoes, and the weary 91st found
their fires lighted by our men, who shared their supper,
scanty as it was, with their exhausted companions.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock on Sunday morning, unwashed and
unshaven, with tattered clothes and rusty arms, we
marched for our standing camp on the Quesana; climbed
the face of the intervening mountain, and crossing its
ridge, saw the white tents spread on the plain below,
which we gained in a couple of hours, and lost no time
in realizing the longed-for luxuries of a bathe and a clean
shirt.</p>

<p>The officers left behind, had got ready a large camp-kettle
of coffee, round which, <i>tin-tot</i> in hand, we all
squatted, from the Colonel downwards, and read the
General's Despatch, and the honourable mention made
of our exertions.</p>

<p>For three days the camp remained stationary, the
General being absent at Fort Hare, and the troops
awaiting commissariat supplies from thence. On the
2nd July, however, we were again in motion, ascending
at day-break another part of the same range as before,
for the purpose of clearing the eastern range of the
Victoria Heights, and of again attacking the enemy's
fastnesses in the forests at the southern point of the
Hogsback.</p>

<p>After a tedious climb, we gained the top of the path,
and looked down on the plain we had just left, where
the pack-horses and mules, like pigmies, wound along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
towards the foot of the ascent. We halted for a couple
of hours on the top of a lower ridge, extended in skirmishing
order, lying down among the rocks and shrubs
along the edge, looking down into the dense bush below,
in which were numerous scattered kraals. From these,
as the Fingoes crashing through the underwood were
heard advancing through the cover, firing, yelling,
and setting everything combustible in flames, the naked
Kaffirs stealthily crept, unaware of the sharpshooters
above.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a party of the 91st and European
Levies attacked the forest stronghold at the southern
point of the Hogsback, and thoroughly cleared it of the
enemy, burnt their huts, and obliged the inhabitants to
take refuge in the highest fastnesses of the lofty Chumie.
Two large villages, which, from being of the same colour
as the rocks among which they stood, had hitherto
escaped our notice, now broke out in flames, sending up
into the still air clouds of heavy white smoke, which
were seen twenty miles off. The Fingoe and Hottentot
Levies, who had been despatched down the valley of the
Amatola, burning every kraal on their way, came on a
lair, or hiding-place, from which we on the heights could
now see the Kaffirs hastily escaping in an opposite direction,
their chief, Oba, "son-of-Tyali," plainly discernible
riding off amongst them, just as the patrol
reached the place; so sudden and unexpected was the
discovery and attack of this retreat, that everything was
abandoned, and Tyali's wives and children, and those
of Oba and other Kaffir grandees, were taken prisoners.
A large quantity of karosses, arms, ornaments, and skins,
were taken, also the chiefs head-dress of cranes' wings
(the insignia of rank), with the full-dress jacket and
cap presented to him by Sir H. Smith. The whole of
the kraals were burnt to the ground. The captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
women were marched through our ranks shortly afterwards,
on their way to the General: their stately carriage
and dignified step were most striking, as they moved
haughtily along with the indescribable ease and grace
of manner peculiar to both Kaffir and Fingo women.
Having been examined and interrogated to little purpose
by the General's interpreter, they were set at liberty,
and wending their way back towards their kraal, now a
heap of smoking ruins, descended the hill, and were
soon lost to sight in the bush below.</p>

<p>The pasturage round our standing camp having become
particularly scanty, we moved, the following
morning, to the N'caga, or Yellow-Woods, three miles
distant.</p>

<p>Just as we had pitched tents, the English mail arrived;
and as the welcome news spread like wildfire, hurrying
from all sides, we flocked towards the panting post-horses,
and as the dusty leather bags were emptied on the
grass, crowded eagerly round for the anxiously-expected
letters, considerably bewildering the Camp-Sergeant-Major
by our zealous assistance in sorting them. Those
lucky enough to get letters from home retired to their
tents, or to the shade of some tree beyond the bustling
camp, to enjoy them&mdash;the disappointed vowing never to
write home again. The escort with the mail had been
attacked in the Ecca valley; the officer in charge (Ensign
Gill, C.M.R.), having had his horse shot under
him, one of his men killed, and two wounded.</p>

<p>We were permitted to rest in camp next day, though
parties of Fingoes were out in all directions, burning and
destroying the deserted Kaffir kraals. The whole afternoon
they kept pouring into camp laden with their spoils;
large quantities of <i>amazimba</i>, Kaffir corn,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> ornaments,
head-dresses, and every kind of Kaffir traps and toggery.
Several women were also brought in prisoners, but sent
about their business after an interview with the General's
interpreter, much to the disappointment of their Fingoe
captors, who, finding they were not to have the pleasure
of putting them to death as they had anticipated, and
highly incensed at their being allowed to return unharmed
to their own people after the trouble they had
been at in taking them, followed the liberated captives out
of the camp, heaping on them every curse and abuse in the
Kaffir vocabulary, and thrashing them with their <i>keeries</i>
(long heavy sticks), which, however, was summarily put a
stop to by us, as soon as noticed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>The part of the camp allotted to these most zealous
allies presented a variety of novel and striking scenes.
On all sides the eye encountered black fellows of stalwart
frame, arraying themselves in the ornaments and
insignia of despoiled <i>Inkosi</i> and <i>Amapakati</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> singing
to themselves in a deep guttural chant, and dancing in a
slow jerking step to some monotonous measure. In a
wide clear space a ring of some three score of these
athletic forms, blankets and karosses thrown aside, began
a war-dance to the strange chorus of their deep voices,
accompanied by regular tapping on a shield of ox-hide.
The performers shook their gleaming assegais in the
air, and jerked their supple frames to and fro, lifting
their feet alternately, or jumping with both, as they sung,
in perfect harmony, a wild air, swelling from a low organ-like
hum to the full power of their lungs; hissing like
serpents, and creeping with bent bodies round and
round, and in and out, as if on the spoor of the enemy;
then breaking out into cries and yells, stabbing furiously
at the imaginary victim in their centre, and shaking
their bodies backward and forward, from the knees upward,
till the perspiration streamed from every pore.
Each verse of the war-song, which was an improvised
commemoration of their late achievements, was given by
a single voice in a loud recitative, and then caught up
by the whole in an astounding chorus,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem">
Ezani, ezani nina Amaxosa,<br />
Sobula noko,&mdash;sobula noko,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Sobula-lá, no-kó!<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span><br />
</div>

<p>In another quarter, round a large iron pot of boiled
Kaffir corn, a knot of gormandizers were collected,
throwing handful after handful of the swelled and steaming
grain down their throats with a steady perseverance
perfectly astonishing; while stretched around lay others,
watching them with looks of mingled helplessness and
envy, their own stomachs already gorged to the utmost
limit.</p>

<p>A party of <i>headmen</i> and older warriors, seated cross-legged
in their tents, ceremoniously smoked the <i>dagha-pipe</i>,
a kind of hookah, made of a bullock's horn, its
downward point filled with water, and a reed stem let
into the side, surmounted by a rough bowl of stone,
which is filled with the <i>dahga</i>, a species of hemp, very
nearly, if not the same, as the Indian <i>bang</i>. Each individual
in the circle receives it in turn, opens his jaws to
their full extent, and placing his lips to the wide open
mouth of the horn, takes a few pulls and passes it on.
Retaining the last draught of smoke in his mouth, which
he fills with a decoction of bark and water from a calabash,
he squirts it on the ground by his side through a
long ornamented tube in his left hand, performing thereon,
by the aid of a reserved portion of the liquid, a sort of
boatswain's whistle, complacently regarding the soap-like
bubbles, the joint production of himself and neighbour.
It appeared to be a sign of special friendliness
and kindly feeling to squirt into the same hole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p>For a few shillings and a little tobacco, we obtained
a number of handsome ornaments taken from the huts
of some of the members of the Gaika Royal Family,
such as bracelets, karosses, &amp;c., with the singular head-dresses,
<i>umnqwazi</i>, made of otter skin and beautiful
bead work, which are the insignia peculiar to female
royalty in Kaffirland.</p>

<p>Next day we returned to Fort Hare, and encamped
on the plain at some distance from the walls. Here we
expected to have had a short rest after the incessant
marching and countermarching of the last few days, as
the morrow would be Sunday, but were doomed to be
disappointed, for soon after sunrise tents were again
struck, and as the early chapel bell tolled for first service,
we marched through the straggling village of Alice,
the clean Sunday dressed settlers wishing us "God-speed,"
and the young Fingoes, as usual, dancing round
our Pipers in ecstasies of delight. The 91st were left
behind to garrison the Fort.</p>

<p>After a hot and dusty march we halted at noon to
rest the oxen, near the ruined and deserted settlement
of Ely, one of the military villages destroyed by the
enemy at the commencement of the war; the houses of
<i>wattle and daub</i> still standing, though without doors
or windows, appeared, from the numerous articles left
in them, such as spades, axes, bayonets, assegais,
bridles, and kettles, to have been most precipitately
abandoned. A march of some miles further, and we
encamped towards evening, about a mile from Fort
Beaufort, within sight of the foreign-looking little
town with its surrounding clusters of neatly built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Fingoe kraals. Next morning we passed through the
town, where there are large excellent stone-built barracks,
and some snug-looking staff-quarters, with cool
verandahs, and high hedges of prickly-pear, enclosing
green compounds, adorned with shady trees and large
American aloes. It was broiling hot, and we were
followed, as usual, by hundreds of Fingoes and Hottentots,
while others huddled round their kraals in motley
groups, and in every stage of undress&mdash;old shrivelled
patriarchs, with blear eyes and grizzly heads; haggard
witches, with long withered breasts hanging down to
their waists; mothers suckling the children tied on
their backs; men, as an apology for dress, covering one
shoulder with a short kaross; and women, with the
most incredible posterior development, whose sole attire
was a skin or kilt tied round the waist, reaching barely
to the knee; while scores of naked little imps, with
enormous stomachs, scuttled about in every direction.</p>

<p>Crossing the Kat river, by a stone bridge, a curiosity
in this part of the world, we marched through an
uninteresting bushy country, to Clu-clu, where we halted
and pitched our camp, half the tents being hidden
from one another by the mimosa bushes. Though one
of the commonest, this is certainly one of the prettiest
trees of the country; its light and graceful form, bright
green feathery foliage, golden clusters of globular
blossom, filling the air with the most delicious perfume,
and bristling array of gigantic white thorns, from three
to six inches long, thickly studding every twig, make
it at all times a striking object. Fortunately there was
plenty of shade, and we lay till sundown under a fine
tree, enjoying the unusual repose. The greater part
of the native Levy attached to our brigade joined here,
having marched from Fort Beaufort, after many parting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
cups, in a very independent and jovial manner, and
contrived to shoot their officer on the road.</p>

<p>7th.&mdash;At daylight, we were awakened by a pouring
rain pattering heavily on our patrol-tents, and congratulated
ourselves that we were not likely to march;
but in less than five minutes the bugle sounded "strike
tents," and the operation of pulling up pegs immediately
commencing, we had to bundle out and arrange our
toilet in the storm. The rain having put out every
fire, and the unexpected march upset the calculations
of servants as well as masters, there was no coffee to be
had, and we marched without it.</p>

<p>A party of Cape Corps, which had been out during
the night, returned with two hundred sheep, and
seventy head of cattle, having killed several Kaffirs.
Four miles marching across a plain, bounded on the
left by fog, and on the right by the dark range of the
Kromme, covered by a canopy of heavy white clouds,
brought us to our halt for breakfast, by the so-called
Yellow Wood River, a large gully, containing here and
there small pools of water, its course marked across
the otherwise bare plain by a belt of the large
willow-like trees,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> from which it derives its name.
We discovered here the corpse of one of the enemy
killed by the Cape Corps party, and not far off a
wounded Kaffir, brought to this point by his comrades,
whom, it seemed, we had nearly surprised at their fires,
on which the meat was still cooking, or rather, burning.
The wounded man wore round his neck a fine string
of tiger's teeth, which one of the Levy officers cut off
and gave me. On seeing the knife approach his throat,
the poor fellow thought it was all over with him, and
clasping his hands, with a deep groan, closed his eyes.
He appeared as much relieved as surprised to find he
had only lost his necklace. The Fingoes, as usual,
wanted to kill him, but were prevented by the officers,
who left the dying warrior some bread and water, and
placed him under the shade in an easier posture.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>The sun now shone bright and hot. Our way lay
across the steaming plain, on which clumps of mimosa
again began to appear; here and there the blackened
ruins of some unfortunate settler's house showed traces
of the destroying enemy. Towards sunset we came to
another green belt of trees that for some time had
formed the only break in the parched and level plain,
and crossed the deep Koonap River in separate bodies,
simultaneously, at four or five different points, by
narrow slippery ledges of rock running across it, and
forming small waterfalls, over which several of the men
slipped into the intervening pools, and, of course, got
a thorough ducking.</p>

<p>Soon after the camp was pitched, a party of our
cavalry, whose firing we had seen on the hills, came in
with three hundred sheep and a few oxen and horses,
(belonging to the owner of one of the ruined farms,)
which they had retaken from the enemy, seven of
whom they had killed, losing one man.</p>

<p>8th.&mdash;Parade at six, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; bitterly cold, the ground
white with hoar frost, and the water in our tents
incrusted with ice; by nine o'clock it was warm to
inconvenience, and, in the sun, scorching hot. We
wandered, gun in hand, along the wooded banks of the
river, where we put up several large monkeys and green
and crimson parrots. An iguana was shot by Gordon,
about three feet and a half long, just as it was wriggling
down the bank to reach the water. Our patrols again
returned from a successful pursuit after marauders,
recapturing one hundred sheep and seventy head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of cattle, with a loss of three on the side of the
enemy.</p>

<p>In two or three days the scanty pasturage, what with
the scorching sun and the hungry cattle, had become
so miserable as to compel us to change our camp.
Accordingly, on the 11th, we struck tents and moved
further up the river, halting near a deserted station, or
<i>Post</i>. Four empty roofless houses, and a chapel without
doors, were all that remained of it. The former still
contained some common broken furniture, which the
men borrowed; and benches, tables, and arm chairs,
were placed round the camp fires, forming the oddest
scene imaginable. The Fingoes, in their ignorance,
made a like use of the fittings of the chapel; the pulpit
was found at one of their fires, converted, with the aid
of a blanket or two, into a snug sort of kennel; it was,
of course, immediately ordered back by the Commanding-officer,
in double-quick time, together with the font, in
which they were grinding coffee with a round stone.</p>

<p>For two or three days we remained in camp, and our
time was occupied in parade and drills, the "extension
motions" greatly amusing the Fingoes, who seemed to
imagine that the squads of men, swinging their arms, and
balancing themselves on one foot, were performing a
solemn war dance.</p>

<p>Macomo was at this time reported to be in the neighbourhood
with a large hostile force, and a party was
sent out against him, before daylight on the 14th,
consisting of five companies of the 74th Highlanders, a
six-pounder howitzer, two hundred Cape Corps, and
the Levies. The patrol was absent two days, and went
through some hard work, having to drag the gun, by
hand, up the steep and narrow Water-Kloof-Pass, and
lift it bodily over large felled trees, placed across the
path by the enemy. A number of Kaffirs were seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and the artillery was brought to bear upon them; owing
to the nature of the cover in which they took refuge, the
effect could not be ascertained, though from the precision
with which the shells were dropped, their loss
must have been considerable. On our side the casualties
were two men killed and one wounded, a couple of
horses also being killed.</p>

<p>On the morning of their return I was sent with an
escort of one hundred men to convey to Fort Beaufort a
train of waggons, containing a quantity of spare arms and
accoutrements to go into the ordnance store, with some
slaughter oxen for the use of that garrison, and to bring
back commissariat supplies for the camp. We were
joined on the way, for the sake of protection, by a
burgher fleeing from his farm, with his wife and family,
and three thousand sheep. We soon neared the spot
where, about a week ago, the wounded Kaffir had
been left; two or three <i>asvogels</i>, or vultures, skimmed
heavily along the ground from a black object, which
proved to be his body, already half devoured.</p>

<p>On the approach of evening we halted on the
<i>open</i>, drawing up the waggons in a circle, with their
dissel-booms outwards. The fires were lighted in
the inner space, and the sentries posted about fifty yards
outside, with an outlying picquet of Fingoes, for the
night was pitch dark, and the neighbourhood infested
with Kaffirs, to whom our flocks and herds were a
great temptation. Wrapped in a plaid, I sat by the
fire contemplating the scene within our little encampment;
on one side the soldiers chatted merrily and
carelessly over their supper; on the other were the
Fingoes, jabbering in their strange dialect; some
cutting up lumps of meat with their sharp assegais,
and others lying round the fires in wild groups; while
the Hottentot drivers, and fore-loupers, sat under their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
own waggons smoking apart; the whole brightly illuminated
by the blazing fires reflected from the circular
wall of white covered waggons. One by one, the men
dropped off to sleep, and I was soon left to my own
thoughts, surrounded by motionless forms rolled in
blankets.</p>

<p>On going the rounds at ten o'clock, I found the Fingoe
Levies had very coolly left their posts, and were sleeping
comfortably by the picquet fire among their comrades.
Calling their sergeant, an immensely big fellow, he
rushed to the fire, and kicked up the slumbering figures
one after another, overhauling them without ceremony
by arms and legs, sorting and turning them over like a
creel of fish, shouting all the time at the top of his voice.
Having found the delinquents, and awarded them "extra
guards" as a punishment, with a threat of the <i>jambok</i>,
or still more dreaded stoppage of rations, in case of
further offence, we marched them back to their posts
giving them to understand, that as they would be visited
every half hour, it would be advisable to keep a good
look out.</p>

<p>What with the angry and incessant barking of the
dogs, the uninterrupted bleating of sheep, and the loud
snoring of the oxen, all attempts to sleep were in vain.
So I sat up, and squatting by the fire, amused myself with
piling on fresh wood, wishing by the way, as the picture
of old Horace occurred to me&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
"Ligna super foco large reponens," &amp;c.,<br />
</div>

<p>that I could lay my hand on some of the "quadrimum
merum," to render the comparison a little more happy.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the moon rose, and I awoke the
bivouac by shouting&mdash;"Inspan." Instantly all were alive;
the Hottentots tumbled out of their waggons, the men
jumped to their feet and folded their blankets, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sentries were called in, and in ten minutes we were
"trekking" across the plain. As we descended the little
hollow of the Clu-clu, enveloped in a thick fog, the
change was most extraordinary, the chilly raw air striking
through us instantaneously, and as suddenly ceasing on
our emerging from it on the opposite side. In many
places the bush by the wayside glowed with bright
scarlet clusters of the bignonia,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which wreathed among
the trees. Suddenly Fort Beaufort opened on us, in the
centre of a green plain below, the fine mountains of the
Elandsberg and Tyumie forming a noble background.</p>

<p>We found the town looking wretchedly dull and deserted,
the garrison being reduced to a small detachment
only of the Cape Mounted Rifles, besides the Levies.</p>

<p>The Commandant ordered the Commissariat to have
the waggons loaded by dark, as the General had directed
their return by moonlight.</p>

<p>We accordingly started at nine o'clock the same evening,
but with only half the original escort, the Fingoes
not making their appearance at the appointed time, their
invariable custom on such occasions, remaining behind,
making merry in the kraals of their friends, with a
glorious disregard of time, and orders. An attack was
fully expected, as well on account of our reduced numbers
and heavily-laden waggons as from the fact that our
errand and return were as well known to the enemy as
ourselves. At midnight we halted to let the oxen graze
for a couple of hours, while the men threw themselves
down on the grass to snatch a little sleep. At two we
were off again. Dark glens, hill, dale, and bush, were
passed without interruption, and we were once more on
open ground. The encampment having been moved
during our absence, I rode forward with the <i>Conductor</i>
(a most valuable assistant, attached to each train of
government waggons), for about two miles, cantering
from one rise to another, looking out for the fires, which
we at last discovered at a considerable distance, and
turning back, put the waggons on the right track, and
reached the camp at daylight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>For a week we remained stationary, patrols going out
almost daily to different parts of the neighbourhood to
check the enemy, who would suddenly appear in the
most opposite directions; one day, for instance, attacking
a train of waggons in the Mancazana, and killing
seven of the escort; and two days after, firing on the
post riders between Fort Beaufort and Graham's Town,
killing six on the spot, and wounding three others.</p>

<p>Those of us who remained in camp amused themselves
with quail shooting, or with reading under the shade of
the yellow-wood trees. Hundreds of turtle-doves swarmed
in every direction; and though at first there were some
scruples about killing them, they were soon remorselessly
shot and converted into pigeon pies. Monkeys and
brilliantly-plumaged <i>touracos</i>, or crested parrots, of a dark
green, with purple and crimson tails and wings, filled the
belt of the wood along the river with their discordant
chattering.</p>

<p>One morning, in beating for quail along a reedy
<i>sluit</i>, or watercourse, we came on the corpses of some of
the Kaffirs killed during the late patrols, which, half
devoured by vultures and jackals, lay festering in the
jungle.</p>

<p>For three days we endured the misery of a sand storm.
The hot air was filled with clouds of fine red sand, driven
by a burning wind, and shutting out every object at a
few yards' distance, blinding the eyes and stifling the
breath, while it not only penetrated the tents, covering
everything with a thick red coating, but even found its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
way into every box and valise. Nothing can be more
wretchedly uncomfortable than one of these inflictions,
unluckily but too common. The skin becomes dry and
hot; an irresistible lassitude is felt, accompanied with
headache; the face and hair are red with sand, which,
to complete the discomfort, finds its way even under
one's clothing. No one ventures out who can possibly
avoid it, though even a house is but a partial protection,
the closest-fitting doors and windows failing to exclude
the finer particles, as the red hue of the furniture quickly
shows. Those who, like ourselves, had no choice, braved
the storm, with heads bent down and eyes half shut,
or shielded by wire goggles with dark blue glasses,
giving a most comical aspect to the wearer.</p>

<p>The sand storm at last blown over, we saw in the
evening a dense smoke rising about two miles off.
A reconnoitring party discovered that the enemy had
set fire to the grass, a common expedient with them
to oblige us to abandon a position inconvenient to
themselves, by destroying the pasturage, and a mode
of ejectment so effective, as generally to have no remedy
but to trek.</p>

<p>As night advanced, the spectacle was really grand,
and all turned out of their tents to look at it; the whole
plain, for miles in extent, being one sheet of flame,
tinging the sky with a lurid red.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
REIT FONTEIN&mdash;STANDING CAMP&mdash;MARCH TO SOMERSET&mdash;ACTION ON KROMME
HEIGHTS&mdash;RETURN TO FORT BEAUFORT.</h2>


<p>Having been thus served with notice to quit, we stayed
but two days longer, and then struck tents and marched
across the dreary charred plain for nine miles; our
clothes, hands, and faces soon becoming as grim as the
blackened ground, from which clouds of impalpable
ashes rose at every step.</p>

<p>We halted at a deserted farm house called Reit
Fontein, having had several shots by the way, at
duykerbok and koran,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> a species of bustard, highly
and deservedly esteemed; its flesh, when roasted, is
very like that of the wild turkey of North America.</p>

<p>The encampment was formed near the house, a short
distance from a garden, containing a spring, by the
side of which grew a large clump of bamboo-looking
reeds, upwards of twenty feet in height; whence the
name of the place. The neighbourhood abounded with
duyker, bosch, and steinbok, small varieties of the
antelope tribe, found singly or in pairs, in the more
open bush; as also paauw,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> another of the bustards,
about the size of a pheasant, with black head and breast,
and finely mottled wings and back; and parties of us
went out almost daily after them, Baird generally
making the best bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 6th I started with Bruce and 200 men for
Somerset, seventy miles distant, to convoy ammunition,
and bring back cattle for our commissariat. The halt
for the first night was on the Koonap, in which we had
a most refreshing bathe. The Fingoes, lower down,
swimming and splashing about like porpoises; the
instant they came out of the river they were as dry as
ever, the water running off their shiny skins as from
a duck's back. On the second day we entered a vast
level sandy plain, unbroken except by immense ant
hills, thousands of which dotted its surface as far as
the eye could reach, fresh ones constantly coming in
sight as we advanced. A deserted farm-house, one or
two of which we passed each day, at long intervals,
served as our hotel at night. We established ourselves
in the empty echoing rooms, lighting fires in the grates,
collecting the scattered chairs and tables, and spreading
our plaids on the cartel bedsteads.</p>

<p>Our march next morning was still over immense
plains, stretching to the horizon. We came on more
farm-houses, abandoned like the rest, in consequence of
the outrages of the enemy, and looking the pictures of
ruin and desolation; doors and windows broken, dried
carcases of sheep and oxen scattered about the front,
with rusted implements of husbandry and broken
furniture; and gardens overgrown with rank waving
grass.</p>

<p>The first herd of springbok was here seen bounding
away from us; and, though hopelessly out of shot,
greatly excited our sporting ardour. Late in the afternoon
we came once more to inhabited dwellings; where,
however, we were not equally at home as in the untenanted
ruins of the previous night. We drew up our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
waggons at the door of a Dutch Boer's house, in a deep
hollow, where was also a little camp of Mounted Levies,
for whom we had brought a supply of ammunition.
As neither the Boer nor any of his family spoke a
word of English, and we were in the like predicament
as to Dutch, and German was useless, our greeting
was in dumb show, and we bowed to each other and
shook hands in solemn silence. Several Dutch families
who had fled from their farms, were living here in their
waggons, which were drawn up together for mutual protection,
close to the house, their flocks and herds grazing
in common. This lively place was called Klip-Fontein.</p>

<p>One of our Fingoes was caught at dusk by the sentry
stealing biscuit from the ration waggon, and was soundly
flogged by his own comrades&mdash;for being found out!</p>

<p>After an early cup of coffee from the Dutchman, who,
with that exception, was uncivil and surly, we wound
our way up the steep path, and again pursued the track
across the sandy plain. The sun rose magnificently
behind a distant range of blue mountains. Lots of
partridges were flushed at every few yards, and afforded
excellent sport for about two hours, when we came
suddenly to the edge of the table-land, from which we
looked down on a beautiful scene, the more novel and
refreshing by contrast with our late march. Instead of
the parched and arid plains we had been traversing for
three days, a fine valley lay at our feet, thickly wooded,
stretching north and south, and bounded by a range of
grassy mountains, rising out of forest, and crowned with
grey cliffs. Countless acres of prickly-pear, contrasting
with the dark bush, spread across the valley, and strips
of bright red earth appearing between, gave to the
whole an indescribable warmth and sunniness. We
descended for about a mile; the cry of the wild pintado
resounding on all sides; then passed through a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
grove of prickly-pear, eight or ten feet high, and having
crossed the Baviaans River at the Roed-Waal drift, so
called from the perpendicular red banks of the stream,
rested under the shadow of the cactus for breakfast, the
sun shining fiercely. Whilst the servants were boiling
the kettle, we enjoyed a bathe in the cool rocky river
overhung with trees, the clear water tumbling and
foaming over huge boulders, taking one's thoughts
back to Tweed-side and the bonnie salmon streams
of old Scotland.</p>

<p>Several farm-houses, fired by the Kaffirs, were smoking
at a distance, in the peaceful looking valley; and
further down we found the road strewn with grain,
thickly trampled, and stained with blood; while from
under a cairn of loosely piled stones, close by among
the bushes, peeped the head and shoulders of a corpse.
An old man, a ruined settler, whose house had been
destroyed by the enemy, had been trekking this way the
day before with his sons, and his last waggon-load of grain,
when they were waylaid by the Kaffirs, who cruelly murdered
two of the defenceless party. Such outrages on the
heart-broken settlers were almost of daily occurrence;
often exasperating them to savage fury, but more
frequently reducing them to helpless despair.</p>

<p>After five and twenty miles' march, we halted at a
drift on the Little Fish River, about a mile from
Somerset, which is a pretty cluster of white houses, gardens,
and orange trees, at the foot of a beautiful green
mountain. This was our resting place for two days
while waiting the arrival of the oxen, hourly expected,
on their way from the Orange River district, and which
we were to escort back for the use of the troops. In the
neighbourhood is a large and celebrated orange grove,
which we visited. It lies at the entrance of a deep
ravine in the mountain, and as we rode up, the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
shone on thousands of ripe oranges, lemons, citrons,
shaddocks, and <i>natches</i>, a very small and peculiar flavoured
kind of orange. The trees, which were of great
size, bent under the weight of fruit, and down the long
avenues the branches almost met overhead. Fingoe
boys, armed with guns, were protecting the fruit from
monkeys, as lads at home watch the corn-fields.</p>

<p>At the <i>Tronk</i>, which we visited with the Civil Commissioner,
we saw about twenty or thirty Kaffir prisoners.
It was Sunday, and they were all assembled in
a large room, heavily chained, dressed merely in a
blanket, and listening, with becoming attention, to a
Fingoe preaching in their own language the full,
flowing, and sonorous tones of which, with the singular
clicks occurring in every other word, sounded both
melodious and striking. A Kaffir boy was handed over
to us as a prisoner, to be taken down to General
Somerset, for sentence. He had been taken a few days
before, by a Commando, which had fallen in with,
and attacked a band of marauders, of which he was
the only one who escaped. Though not more than
sixteen years of age, he carried a gun and a bundle of
assegais. He had been spared by the Commandant,
at the request of his <i>after-rider</i>, who begged the boy's
life from the hard-hearted Boer, as a reward for his
own long and faithful services. He was a handsome
quiet lad, and when reassured, through the kindness of
our men, who gave him a pipe and tobacco, with
plenty of food and a seat at the fire, he seemed quite
happy. His name was <i>Uyanina</i>, and he told us,
through our interpreter, that his father and two
brothers had been killed in the Amatolas; and, in a
quiet tone, said that he hoped we would not kill
him, as he wanted to go back to his mother. He was
told that his life was safe, but that as he could bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
arms, we could not let him loose again until after
the war; with which assurance he appeared perfectly
satisfied, and lay contentedly smoking the strongest
tobacco all day long. In due time the cattle arrived,
driven by a party of strange, ragged, wild-looking
Gonahs, and one thousand sheep and seven hundred
oxen were bleating and bellowing around us. The
Contractor (having provided himself with a few rounds
of dry sheep's dung, as markers) counted them over
to our commissariat agent, depositing one of the
pellets in his right hand as each hundredth ox rushed
through the two trees between which they were all
driven singly.</p>

<p>As we returned the cattle suffered severely from
want of pasturage; not a blade of grass was to be seen,
and our horses, which had nothing to eat but the leaves
of trees and shrubs during the day, when tied up at
night devoured sticks, wood, dry dung, or anything
chewable. On the plain we had the good fortune to
fall in with several herd of springbok; their beautiful
appearance and graceful agility delighted us, as they
leaped into the air, clearing twenty feet at a bound. A
party of Dutch Boers <i>jagging</i> them and firing above,
drove a herd in our direction, giving us some splendid
shots. I kept the head of one, and amused myself in
the evening by the camp fire, at Klip-Fontein, by
preparing it as a specimen. The tongue, liver, and
heart, made an excellent fry, though the flesh is
generally dry and tasteless, and requires all the cook's
art to render it at all equal to tolerable venison.</p>

<p>More herds were seen the following day, and we
galloped after them, over the level plain, for miles,
without a check, cutting them off at angles, and getting
long shots every now and then. A brilliant full moon
illuminated our bivouac, and the Fingoes got up their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
customary dance, which they always celebrate at the
change; though no longer new to us, it had lost none
of its wild interest. A hundred and fifty fine brawny
fellows, throwing off their blankets, joined in the strange
chorus, dancing and leaping, and brandishing their
gleaming assegais in the bright moonlight.</p>

<p>The afternoon following found us in camp again
after an absence of eight days.</p>

<p>Patrols and escorts went out daily in every direction,
and "light drill," morning and evening, occupied those
who remained behind.</p>

<p>To make our quarters a little more comfortable, we
set to work and built high circular hedges or kraals of
green boughs round our fires, the narrow entrance facing
the tent door. After levelling the enclosed space, we
furnished them with camp tables and stools, for the
tents, what with the sun and the flies, were unbearable
during the day, and were used only for sleeping in.
The swarms of common house-flies that collected in our
tents were really wonderful, the canvas was literally
black with them, as well as every dish and can, the
moment they were placed on the table; as soon as the
sun rose, one was awakened by a cloud of them settling
on one's face, fighting in one's ears, and buzzing in
one's hair; making the most amiable men give way to
harsh language. At last we were obliged to blow them up,
once or twice a day, either by surrounding a tempting
heap of ration sugar with a train of powder, or by
hoisting a charge to the top of the tent, on a board
stuck on the point of a claymore, though this plan
had the disadvantage of sometimes setting the canvas
on fire, and invariably covering the performer with a
shower of singed flies.</p>

<p>We were frequently visited by whirlwinds, which
caused a little variety in the camp; a cloud of sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
would come eddying along, tear up a kraal, sending
the bushes flying in every direction, whisk the men's
caps off their heads, whirl loose papers, shirts, and
other articles high into the air, level two or three
tents, and sail away in an opposite direction, leaving
its course through the camp distinctly marked by the
track it had cleared.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the month it fell to my lot to
escort a large train of commissariat waggons to Graham's
Town, fifty miles off. On the Koonap hill, we passed
the dead horses of the post-riders, shot there on the
23rd of July, and saw the marks of the bullets scored
along the rocks. When in the middle of the Ecca
valley we spied a large body of red coats, who, as
we neared each other, proved to be a party of the
91st, among whom were some old friends. Soon after
parting with them, a number of Kaffirs showed themselves
on the hills just above us, watching our movements.</p>

<p>Further down the valley a bosch-buck and a wild
boar fell to my rifle; the latter was a splendid fellow,
with an enormous head; he must have been at least
five feet and a half in length, and two feet and a
half high, and had besides his two immense tusks, a
singular bony protuberance on each cheek. The
Fingoes cut him up in a very few minutes, and resumed
their march, each with a joint or lump of meat over his
shoulder, spitted on his gun. This valley is said to be
a favourite resort of the boar, on account of the immense
quantities of the <i>strelitzia regina</i>, on the roots of
which it feeds; we observed many newly grubbed up;
the bush glowed with its handsome red flowers. On
outspanning to feed the oxen, a body of Kaffirs showed
themselves, and hovered round the cattle with a pretty
evident intention of making a sweep of them; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
perceiving we were on the alert, thought better of it,
and took themselves off.</p>

<p>The waggon drivers, who are the most insolent and
disagreeable men in the world to have anything to do
with, having refused to obey the order "to inspan,"
the Fingoes were sent to bring in their oxen, and two
of the most refractory drivers being dismissed on the
spot, from the Government service, the rest inspanned at
once, and by the afternoon we entered Graham's Town.</p>

<p>Here we were detained three days, when we set out
on our return with a six pounder gun-carriage and
limber, and a large train of waggons laden with
biscuit, rice, coffee, salt, tobacco, and all sorts of
supplies for the troops on the Frontier. Another of
the English drivers proving refractory and grossly insolent,
was hand-cuffed with a rheim, and marched a
prisoner between a couple of Fingoes, passing the next
three nights in the cells at the military posts on the
road, a piece of martial law which had a most salutary
effect on the rest of these independent gentlemen.</p>

<p>On our last day's march, just as evening was drawing
in, we came upon the fresh spoor of a body of Kaffirs,
not ten minutes old, the print of the bare feet being
quite sharp in the fine dust. Its direction was across
the track towards a patch of bush commanding the
road. The waggons closed quickly up, the men examined
their locks, flank patrols of Fingoes were thrown
out in advance, and all were on the <i>qui vive</i>; but the
enemy, who delight only in surprises, did not show, and
the camp at Reit Fontein was reached without adventure.
Once more patrols were our occupation by day,
and <i>forelaying parties</i>, or ambuscades, by night; marauding
rebels were constantly fallen in with, and killed,
and cattle and horses recaptured.</p>

<p>General Somerset, with a detachment of the 74th and
Cape Corps which had accompanied him into the distric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of Albany, was at this time actively engaged in
following up the enemy in the direction of Riebeck,
Hell-Poort, and the Zuurberg hills, and on the 30th of
August attacked a considerable body of them on New-year
River, where they had taken up a strong position
in a very difficult and rugged kloof, dislodging and dispersing
them with great loss, besides recapturing 160
head of stolen cattle and some horses.</p>

<p>Two days after this affair the 2nd Queen's regiment,
just arrived in the country, under Lieut.-Col. Burns,
had a sharp brush with Botman's and Seyolo's people
in the Fish River bush, with several casualties on both
sides.</p>

<p>The Kaffirs in our neighbourhood having become,
during the General's absence in Albany, unusually bold
and troublesome, stealing cattle, murdering and destroying
on every side, Lieut.-Col. Fordyce, 74th Highlanders,
then commanding the field force in the General's absence,
determined to check their daring conduct by
attacking them at once with his whole available force in
their expected position on the Western Kroome range.
We marched from our camp a little before sunset on the
evening of September 7th, so as to reach the top of the
hill under which we were encamped, just at dark, and
thereby prevent our movement being observed by the
enemy's scouts. After marching about seven miles in
the dark across a level plain, myriads of fire-flies flitting
along the ground, we halted at the ruins of a farm, on
the Klu-Klu River, belonging to a Mr. Gilbert, whose
narrow and extraordinary escape a few months before
from the hands of the Kaffirs deserves mention. He
was riding with two others from Graham's Town to Fort
Hare, when they were waylaid; his companions escaped,
but his own horse being shot he crept into the bush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
successfully evading the search of the Kaffirs, who
passed and re-passed his place of concealment, and at
last sat down to smoke within a few yards of his hiding-place,
their dogs all the while snuffing about. When at
length they moved away, he took off his boots to prevent
the snapping of rotten sticks betraying him, and listening
at every painful step, worked his way through the thorny
bush, and with his feet dreadfully lacerated eventually
reached Fort Hare, where he had been given up as dead.</p>

<p>The ruined house was reconnoitred, and we were told
to lie down and take what rest we could till midnight,
to be ready to turn out at a moment's notice. The
horses were picketed to the broken fence of a grass-grown
pleasure-garden, and the men lay down by companies
in the farm-yard, with their arms piled in front of
each rank. As fires were forbidden, we groped about in
the dark among the fallen ruins, and made the best
resting-places we could on the heaps of broken slates and
brick-ends covering the floors of the blackened chambers,
to which the starry sky served as roof. At midnight we
were joined by Lieut.-Col. Sutton and a party of Cape
Corps and mounted Levies from Fort Beaufort, making
up our force to 550 infantry and 103 mounted men.</p>

<p>At two in the morning we marched out of the melancholy
desolate place across the open for about seven
miles, toward the position supposed to be occupied by
the enemy, and reached it just at daybreak, when we
discovered that the Kaffirs had abandoned it, and that
the large fires reported in this direction had only been
burning grass. After a short halt, while this reconnaissance
was being made, and during which we felt the cold
most intensely, the whole column was counter-marched,
and proceeded in an easterly direction along the foot of
the mountain range for about three hours, when a halt was
made for breakfast at Blakeways, a deserted farm, beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
situated in a warm sheltered glen, finely wooded,
through which the Wolf River wound its way. Numbers
of boschbok, disturbed by our approach, were seen
scudding across the open flat. While at breakfast an
alarm was given that a large body of Kaffirs was descending
the hill in our direction; but they proved to be
a part of the Fort Beaufort Fingoe Levy taking a short
cut to join us. The long dry grass among which we
were halted caught fire, and burned so rapidly as to
threaten to surround the column, roaring and crackling
on every side; and we had to decamp in a hurry to
avoid being blown up or shot by the fire reaching the
men's ammunition or muskets. Here it was ascertained
that the greater part of the enemy were in the Waterkloof,
Blinkwater, and Fuller's Hoek, and therefore, as
it was out of the question to attempt openly attacking
those strongholds with our inadequate force, Lieut.-Col.
Fordyce determined on gaining the top of the Kroome
Heights at this boundary of the range, and, bivouacking
there till dark, make a descent by night, on whichever
point might prove advisable.</p>

<p>At once, therefore, we began to ascend the steep face
of the mountain, the heat of the sun most intense,
not a breath of air stirring, and after two hours' stiff
climbing, reached the edge of a forest spreading up the
higher ranges. Its shade was most refreshing. From
this point we were obliged to proceed in single file, as
the steep and difficult path became so narrow; leading
along a sharp crest like the ridge of a roof, on each side
of which was a wooded precipice, the base of which was
lost to sight in the deep ravines beneath. On reaching
the summit of the mountain a fine view lay spread before
us, the tops of the forest trees below looking like small
bushes. Through an opening in the mountain tops we
caught a peep of the distant sunny plain, with the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
houses of Fort Beaufort and the winding Kat River. Our
own position was a lofty table-land, clothed with grass and
surrounded by bush, the edges of the forest running up from
the valleys below. On one side was the Waterkloof, on
the other the head of the Fuller's Hoek, from which we
were separated by a broad belt of forest stretching right
across the mountain-top. A single path led through it,
difficult and narrow; and its entrance was guarded by
a number of Kaffirs, who appeared to be waiting our
advance. But this was not our intention, for at mid-day
we were halted in a little hollow, through which ran a
small stream; and here our march was to be suspended
till dark.</p>

<p>The guards were mounted on two commanding ridges,
the sentries posted, and the men lay down to rest, or
lighted fires and prepared to cook their rations, to which
they had added the flesh of two Kaffir oxen just captured;
the cavalry horses were knee-haltered and turned
out to graze close round,&mdash;and all was repose.</p>

<p>We had with us, through a misunderstanding, our
Band-master, Hartung, who had left Fort Beaufort with
Lieut.-Col. Sutton's party under the impression that it
was proceeding to the camp at Reit Fontein, which he
was anxious to visit. On finding how different its destination,
he repeatedly expressed his annoyance, and his
apprehension of an engagement. We had not long been
here when a party of officers who had gone up with their
glasses to the top of one of the ridges, came quickly down
and ordered the men to get under arms at once, as the
Kaffirs were approaching in hundreds, running full speed
from every quarter. Instantly all was activity; the men
sprang up from their rest, horses were driven in, accoutrements
hurried on, the untasted contents of soup-kettles
emptied on the grass, and pack-horses loaded
with incredible dispatch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, being Officer-on-duty, I doubled out
with the advance guard, speedily extending, in skirmishing
order, along the ridge, above which the enemy were
advancing, and with whom the next moment we were
exchanging shots at very short range. They were almost
hidden by the long grass in which they crouched to fire,
and their numbers being overwhelming, the reply we
made to their fire was but a temporary check, so that we
were soon being gradually forced back, when Captain
Duff came rapidly up with a company of the 74th, and
reinforced our line of skirmishers; the whole fixed
bayonets, charged the enemy's line with the Highland
shout, and drove them back into the bush.</p>

<p>The column, which had got under arms with the
greatest celerity during this skirmish, now came up, and
the Colonel formed the whole infantry in extended order,
with the right on the head of the Wolf's-back Pass, and
the left "thrown back," the 74th being placed on either
flank, with the irregular infantry in the centre; Lieut.-Col.
Sutton, with the cavalry, remaining for the present
in the rear as a support. The enemy, who had again
advanced on the open plain during this movement, now
came on in hundreds, running and yelling out their war-cry
till within range, when an uninterrupted fire rattled
along the lines on both sides, though, as we were well
covered behind the ridge, we had no casualties beyond
Colonel Fordyce's charger being shot under him.</p>

<p>An immensely big Kaffir was noticed rushing down
the opposite ridge, which was not more than 800 yards
distant, and running at full speed across our line of fire;
unmindful of a shower of balls that fell around him, and
at his very feet, he kept straight on towards our right as
though he bore a charmed life, shouting, and encouraging
the others to follow, as he headed them in an attempt
to gain the Pass, and turn our right flank by moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
along the edge of the forest. But in this they were
foiled by Colonel Fordyce, who immediately ordered the
line "to take ground to the right," while the mounted
force, galloping to the front, gave them a volley from
their carbines that told among them severely. For half
an hour we maintained a sharp skirmish with only a
loss of three killed and as many wounded, when the
enemy retired on the forest, leaving us in undisputed
possession of the ground. As so much ammunition had
been expended it was useless now to wait for night and
make our intended descent; the cavalry, therefore, was
dispatched to the head of another pass, to hold it till
our arrival. Macomo himself, at the same moment, conspicuously
mounted on a white horse, led about 300
mounted Kaffirs to secure the same point, in which object,
however, they were defeated. As soon as we began
descending the Pass, the enemy again rushed in from
all points, lining the forest through which it led.</p>

<p>The road being exceedingly steep, narrow and rugged,
the cavalry in front marched down at a foot's pace, the
infantry following, and the Fingoe Levies bringing up the
rear. The enemy concealed in the thick bush opened
fire upon us the moment we entered the pass, wounding
one of our men. We returned their fire whenever the
smoke showed us where they lay, and thus continued
our descent, with a desultory fire on both sides, till about
half way down, when they showed in still greater force,
filling the bush on both sides of us. The Fingoes in
the rear now evinced their fears so strongly as to encourage
a party of Kaffirs, armed with assegais, to rush
in among them. This completed their panic, and firing
right and left, at random, they hurried headlong down
the narrow path <i>en masse</i> upon our rear with such force as
to knock down and trample on many of our men, while
by crushing through the ranks they hindered the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
from loading. Emboldened by this, the main body
rushed from their cover, hurled a discharge of their
lighter throwing assegais, and then (with the heavier
kind, used for stabbing), threw themselves upon us. Our
steady fellows had little to depend on but their bayonets,
to the use of which they had fortunately long been
regularly trained, and now used most effectually. The
underwood swarmed with Kaffirs, they were perched in
the trees, firing upon us from above, and rushed from
the bush below in hundreds, yelling in the most diabolical
and ferocious manner, hissing through their
white teeth; their bloody faces, brawny limbs, and
enormous size, giving them a most formidable appearance.</p>

<p>The narrow road was crowded with a mass of troops,
Levies and Kaffirs, the ringing yells of the latter heard
above the din of the firing. Some wrestling with the
men for their firelocks, were blown almost in pieces, and
many were felled and brained by the butt-ends of clubbed
muskets. Our gallant fellows fought most bravely; one
man, with an assegai deeply buried between his shoulders,
singled out its owner, and shot him through the head
with the weapon nearly protruding through his chest;
a grenadier killed four Kaffirs with his own hand. The
huge fellow already mentioned appeared suddenly among
us, and seizing a soldier in his powerful grasp, hurled
him to the ground; but the man jumping to his feet in
a moment, buried his bayonet in the fellow's back, and
he fell dead on his face. Three Kaffirs had caught
one of our men by the blanket folded on his back,
and were dragging him into the bush, when the straps
slipping over his shoulders, released him, and he threw
himself, unarmed, on the nearest, and wrestled with him
for his assegai, both rolling over and over, scuffling on
the ground, the well-greased body of the Kaffir giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
him the advantage over the dressed and belted soldier,
whose death wound was, however, amply avenged. The
ground was soon thickly strewn with the black corpses
of the enemy; a score lay in the path, and here and
there the lifeless form of a dead or dying Highlander,
eight of whom fell, while as many more were wounded.
Fighting our way through hundreds of the infuriated
savages, we effected the descent of the pass; by the
time we had reached the foot the enemy's fire had
almost ceased.</p>

<p>On gaining the open ground, we extended and moved
leisurely along the plain, the Kaffirs contenting themselves
with remaining at the edge of the bush on the rise
of the hill, a dense red mass of some two thousand men;
a few scattered parties dodging from tree to tree, fired
long shots, which fell far short, and to which we made
no return, our ammunition being nearly expended.</p>

<p>Our total casualties, were fifteen men and four horses
killed, and fourteen men wounded. Many of the men's
arms and accoutrements were shattered and perforated
by balls. Lieutenant Corrigan was so stunned by a bullet
which passed through his forage cap, as to be partially
unconscious for some time. Hartung was reported
missing, and great fears were expressed for his safety;
yet, as he had not been seen to fall, it was hoped he
might have taken to the bush, and escaped. The unfortunate
chance which brought him out against his will,
and his evident foreboding the whole morning, added to
the general feeling of anxiety about him.</p>

<p>We marched slowly across the plain towards the deserted
farm we had left in the morning; for now that
the excitement was over, we felt the full fatigue of such
uninterrupted exertion, and dragged our limbs heavily
along; the groans of the wounded and the shadows of
evening increasing the gloom of the dreary scene. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
had been quite dark for some time when we reached the
welcome ruin. A mounted express was despatched for
more ammunition, and a waggon to convey the wounded
to the camp. Having disposed of them as comfortably
as it was possible in the mean time, and lighted fires, we
threw ourselves once more on the slates and brickbats,
after having been on foot for seventeen hours.</p>

<p>During the night the waggon arrived; and at three
o'clock we were roused from our rough but reluctantly-quitted
beds, and shivering with the cold, which at this
hour is most intense, moved off towards Reit Fontein,
more asleep than awake, and in about two hours and a
half arrived in camp, nearly done up.</p>

<p>Further inquiries among the men about poor Hartung
confirmed our worst fears. He had been seen by several
endeavouring to lead his horse, and was repeatedly
advised to leave it, but refused, as it had been a borrowed
one. A bugler stated, that soon afterwards he had seen
him wounded by an assegai and then seized by half a
dozen Kaffirs, who dragged him into the bush. His fate
was not difficult to conjecture, and proved afterwards to
have been more horribly cruel than our worst suspicions
had suggested. It was elicited from some Kaffir women,
taken prisoners shortly afterwards by Lieut.-Col. Eyre's
column, that the unfortunate man had been brutally
tortured for three days, cut with assegais, and daily deprived
of a joint from each toe and finger, till death terminated
his dreadful sufferings. Their accounts were
but too truly confirmed by subsequent evidence taken
before the Civil Commissioner of Beaufort, from another
prisoner, Numkani, a Kaffir girl of N'pai, who detailed
the tragic particulars as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was living with the sister of my father, in the Kat
River country before the war. When the war broke out,
I went with her to Waterkloof; she had three sons, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>went there to fight; they were all alive when I came
away from Waterkloof, about three moons since. Before
that, I heard of a white man having been taken prisoner
on the mountains of the Kroome; I heard that he was
killed by the Hottentots. I also heard that he was
taken to Macomo, and that Macomo sent for one of his
sons, Kona, a <i>headman</i> named Queque, and some
Hottentots. Macomo ordered the man to be killed.
He was taken away and stripped, and Queque took his
clothes. I saw him wear them after; the coat was dark,
I cannot say what colour. I heard say that the men
cut his arms and legs. He was two days in that state;
the flesh was not quite cut off, but was left hanging to
his body. They then cut * * * and gave him
his own flesh to eat. They killed him at last by shooting
him. I did not see this, but I heard the men often talk
about it. I heard that the white man spoke, and said
they must not kill him; and that he was begging for his
life. I heard that the women danced round him, and
were merry; they were Kaffir women. They also beat
him with keeries. I heard the men and women singing
a war-song when dancing round the white man. He
had his hands tied behind him by one of Macomo's sons,
named Kona, and the Hottentots; he was lying in the
sun all day, and placed in a hut for safety at night. I
was out gathering gum the day that the Hottentots first
cut the man with a knife; he was tied with a long rheim,
and the end was fastened to a tree. This I heard: when
they cut his arms and legs, he bled much; he was lying
on his side; he screamed when he was cut. They
took off a joint of every finger every day while he was
alive, and after the flesh of his arms and legs had been
cut. I left Waterkloof a long time since, and came to
Fort Beaufort. I left Waterkloof because I was starving."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the fetish-like cruelties perpetrated by
these savages; nor can one wonder at their barbarity
when they are hardly less brutal towards those of their
own race and kindred. When a chief or great man
of a tribe is seized with sickness, the 'witch-doctor,'
with forms and incantations, dooms some poor wretch to
death, on pretence of his having bewitched the ailing
man; his flocks and herds are forfeited to the chief, and
his children left beggars and fatherless.</p>

<p>One instance may suffice to give an idea of their
savage ferocity, and spare the repetition of outrages on
the poor settlers, or those unhappy enough to fall into
their hands.</p>

<p>"The same Kona, some years before, having fallen sick,
a 'witch doctor' was, according to custom, consulted,
to ascertain the individual under whose evil influence he
was suffering; and, as usual, a man of property was selected,
and condemned to forfeit his life for his alleged
crime. To prevent his being told of his fate by his
friends, a party of men left Macomo's kraal early in the
morning to secure the recovery of the sick young chief
by murdering one of his father's subjects. The day
selected for the sacrifice appeared to have been a sort of
gala day with the unconscious victim; he was in his
kraal, had just slaughtered one of his cattle, and was
merrily contemplating the convivialities of the day before
him, over which he was about to preside. The arrival
of a party of men from the 'great place' gave him no
other concern than as to what part of the animal he
should offer them as his guests. In a moment, however,
the ruthless party seized him in his kraal; when he
found himself secured with a rheim around his neck, he
calmly said, 'It is my misfortune to be caught unarmed,
or it should not be thus.' He was then ordered to produce
the matter with which he had bewitched the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
his chief; he replied, 'I have no bewitching matter;
but destroy me quickly if my chief has consented to my
death.' His executioners said they must torture him
until he produced it, to which he answered, 'Save yourselves
the trouble, for torture as you will I cannot produce
what I have not.' He was then held down on the
ground, and several men proceeded to pierce his body
all over with long Kaffir needles. The miserable victim
bore this with extraordinary resolution; his tormentors
tiring, and complaining of the pain it gave their hands,
and of the needles or skewers bending. During this
time a fire had been kindled, in which large flat stones
were placed to heat; the man was then directed to rise,
they pointed out to him the fire, telling him it was for
his further torture, unless he produced the bewitching
matter. He answered, 'I told you the truth when I said,
save yourselves the trouble; as for the hot stones, I can
bear them, for I am innocent; I would pray to be strangled
at once, but that you would say I fear your torture.'
Here his wife, who had also been seized, was stripped
perfectly naked, and cruelly beaten and illtreated before
his eyes. The victim was then led to the fire, where he
was thrown on his back, stretched out with his arms and
legs tied to strong pegs driven into the ground, and the
stones, now red hot, were taken out of the fire and
placed on his naked body&mdash;on the groin, stomach, and
chest, supported by others on each side of him, also
heated and pressed against his body. It is impossible
to describe the awful effect of this barbarous process, the
stones slipping off the scorched and broiling flesh, and
being only kept in their places by the sticks of the
fiendish executioners. Through all this the heroic fellow
still remained perfectly sensible, and when asked if he
wished to be released to discover his hidden charm said,
'Release me.' They did so, fully expecting they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
vanquished his resolution, when, to the astonishment of
all, he stood up a ghastly spectacle, broiled alive! his
smoking flesh hanging in pieces from his body! and
composedly asked his tormentors, 'What do you wish
me to do now?' They repeated their demand, but he
resolutely asserted his innocence, and begged them to
put him out of his misery; and as they were now getting
tired of their labour, they made a running noose on the
rheim around his neck, jerked him to the ground, and
savagely dragged him about on the sharp stones; then,
placing their feet on the back of his neck, they drew
the noose tight, and strangled him. His mangled corpse
was taken into his own hut, which was set on fire and
burnt to ashes. His sufferings commenced at ten <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
and ended only at sunset!" These are the people whom
an Exeter Hall spouter compares to "the ancient Scots
fighting for their homes and hearths."</p>

<p>Two days after our return to camp, information
arrived of a severe and disastrous affair in the Fish
River bush the day following the Kroome action. It
had occurred between a patrol, under Colonel Mackinnon,
and the allied Rebels and Kaffirs in that district, one of
their strongest and most dangerous retreats. A party of
our forces, having got separated in the thick bush, was
cut off, one officer (Captain Oldham) and thirty-one rank
and file being killed, and twenty-three wounded in the
2nd Queen's, with one officer killed and one wounded in
the Levies, besides several men. The enemy, who by
the way used fierce dogs to pull down the troops, had
suffered considerably, and the following day were attacked
and routed by Lieut.-Col. Eyre with heavy loss,
after a sharp engagement, in which two of his officers,
Lieutenant Walters and Ensign Thursby, were wounded.</p>

<p>On the 12th, General Somerset, who had broken up
and dispersed the enemy in the Albany district, and recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a number of cattle, returned to his head-quarter
camp with our two companies and the Cape Corps, which
had been with him, bringing also a detachment of the
12th regiment, just arrived from the Mauritius.</p>

<p>The effects of the hardships, privations, and constant
exposure to the extremes of heat and cold, began to tell
among our ranks; many of the men went into hospital
with diarrh&oelig;a, dysentery, and pulmonary complaints;
and among others Major Fordyce was obliged to return
home on sick leave, his health completely broken up.</p>

<p>During this period constant skirmishes were taking
place with the enemy throughout the frontier districts,
and almost daily depredations and murders were perpetrated
by them on the colonists; the disaffection among
the Hottentots increasing rather than otherwise, and the
rest of the farmers leaving the frontier with what little
remained to them of their herds and property. This
state of things, coupled with the report of a wounded
rebel prisoner, who stated that the Kaffirs were preparing
to attack Graham's Town as soon as they had got
together 5,000 men, which force was nearly completed,
induced the inhabitants of that place to organize themselves
in armed bodies for their own protection; places
of rendezvous in different parts of the town being selected
from their convenience and capability of defence.
The churches and chapels were appointed as refuges for
the women and children in case of attack, and the
signals were to be the firing of a gun and the ringing of
the bells. For the further security of the district,
Lieut.-Col. Eyre was stationed in the neighbourhood
with a strong force.</p>

<p>To return to our own position in the camp at Reit
Fontein, we were during this time resting inactive for
want of reinforcements to enable us to attack the enemy
in his strongholds. Our routine of camp life, relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
only by sketching and shooting round the immediate
neighbourhood, was almost unbroken by any incident,
though once or twice we had a little variety in the shape
of expected night attacks, ending however in smoke,
the guards "turning out" as well as orderly officers
at the sound of firing about midnight, which proved on
each occasion to have been at the expense of a stray
horse or two, doubtless impressing the Kaffirs with a
great idea of our vigilance. Some of the mistakes that
occasionally occurred were rather amusing, at least to
those not personally concerned. A horse of Patton's
having broke loose one night, and wandered outside
the camp to enjoy a little fresh grass to himself, incautiously
advanced straight toward a sentry, by whom he
was twice challenged, and not answering was shot
through the chest; when the Corporal-of-the-guard
visited his post the sentry reported it, and pointed out
the direction of the disabled Kaffir, with a quiet remark
that "he'd been graning awfu." On another occasion
an old soldier, rather deaf, was posted, on a pitch dark
and windy night, at an angle of the camp, on the other
face of which was an artilleryman. The two had quietly
paced their respective beats for some time, wrapped up
as usual in their blankets, when old Tait, for some unaccountable
reason or other, took it into his head to challenge
his fellow sentry, and not hearing any answer concluded
at once that he must be a Kaffir, brought him
down by a shot in the arm, and running in, held his
bayonet steadily at the poor fellow's throat, declaring
"he'd rin him through if he offered to budge." Spite
of the man's representations, which were all lost on
Tait's deaf ear, he kept him down till the Corporal came
round, to the 'relief' of both.</p>

<p>A reinforcement of 120 Fingoe Levies arrived from
Algoa Bay, and the remainder of the 12th regiment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
said to be <i>en route</i> for Beaufort to join our division,
which was to move on that place. The rumour was confirmed
sooner than we had anticipated, for on the following
day "the route" arrived, and was hailed with
delight by all, after having been more than two months
in this place.</p>

<p>The tents were struck; the dry withered kraals that
had encircled our fires were piled over them and set in
a blaze as farewell bonfires, and we marched for Fort
Beaufort, the cavalry and artillery making a detour by
the Klu-Klu to reconnoitre the Kroome. After a hot
and dusty march, as we were entering Beaufort our
band, which had been stationed here since we last passed
through, came out to meet us; its strains sounded
strangely full and rich to our ears after the constant
skirling of the Pipes, and the effect on the men was most
inspiriting as it played us through the long street and
square to the plain on the other side of the town, where
we encamped with the 12th regiment on the banks of
the Kat River.</p>

<p>The Cape Mounted Rifles had their head-quarters
here; and after making the best toilet our weather-stained
uniform would admit of, we rode over to their
mess-house, and once more sat down to the refinement
of a civilized table and decent cookery. After our rough
camp life, the change from tin cans and clasp knives, on
the bare ground, to such luxuries as table cloth, chairs,
plate, and glass, was quite perplexing; savoury dishes
in place of leathery beef, and sparkling champagne
instead of draughts of muddy stagnant water; the merry
party, and warm and cordial greetings of old friends
whom we somehow felt surprised to find alive, were
enjoyed with a zest and heartiness which compensated
for many a hard day in the field.</p>

<p>All things, however, have their drawbacks, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
found that the plain was peculiarly fitted for "light
drill," of which we had a full benefit during our short
<i>rest</i>. Two days after our arrival, a horrible murder was
committed on the Provost-Sergeant, by a man of the
European Levy. He had followed his victim out of the
camp at night, and murdered him in cold blood a few
hundred yards off, then quietly re-entering the lines at
another point, joined his comrades at their fire. At
the court-martial, held two days afterwards, the wretch
was condemned to death, but his sentence was afterwards
commuted to transportation for life.</p>

<p>Though our patrols were out each day as usual, they
now seldom fell in with any of the enemy, whose withdrawal
from their former outposts, and reported gathering
in the Waterkloof, led us to suspect some intended
movement in that quarter. Some Kaffir women captured
by the Fingo Levies one morning, on being examined
by the General's interpreter, admitted their loss on the
day of the Kroome action, September 8th, to have been
upwards of 150 killed, besides many wounded.</p>

<p>The weather how became daily warmer; we paraded
every morning at six o'clock; and after a couple of hours'
light-drill on the plain were right glad to remove the
sand and perspiration by a bathe in the shady river.
On Sundays divine service was performed at nine o'clock
in camp, the men drawn up in hollow square facing
inwards, the "Meenister" in the centre, with the big
drum as a pulpit. Even at that early hour the heat
was often so great that several men fainted during the
service. The surface of the plain danced in a wavy
indistinct outline, and the distorted bushes quivered in
the hot air; yet the Fingoes, bare-headed and without
covering, basked in the broiling sun, smoking their large
wooden pipes in evident enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Though capital bush-rangers, and fair fighting men
when well backed up by regular troops, these fellows
gave us endless trouble from the difficulty of impressing
on them the necessity of some sort of order and discipline.
It was impossible to keep them in camp anywhere
within six or seven miles of a town, and of Beaufort
more especially; they were always in the Fingo quarters
of the town, and out of the way when required, so that in
case of a sudden call for their services, the Sergeants
had to gallop off to the different kraals to hunt them up,
turning them out with great shouting, and blowing of
cow-horns.</p>

<p>The Fingo Levies were universally fine athletic well
made men, and those of the Algoa Bay Levy especially
so; more perfect models it is impossible to imagine.
This superiority arises doubtless from their simple diet,
and free and hardy life in the open air, though it is said
that they, as well as the Kaffirs, always destroy blind,
deaf and dumb, sickly, or deformed children at their
birth, or as soon as their imperfection becomes manifest.
Whether this be true or not, certain it is that no such
are ever seen among them.</p>

<p>In town the young men get themselves up in the most
extraordinary style, with smart earrings in their ears,
and school-boys' caps stuck on the top of their heads,
with red and blue velvet tassels; and you daily see them
at the stores, laying out their pay in second-hand
European clothes,&mdash;blue coats with brass buttons, tight
fitting surtouts, and fashionable pantaloons; an accompanying
party of friends assisting and advising with the
greatest gravity. Some showed a strong military turn,
stitching broad red stripes down their trowsers, or with
an old Cape Corps jacket, swaggering about with a rusty
sword and spurs. But in the field, this attire is laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
aside, and the same fellows pass you on the line of march,
at the double, with a "Hi Charlie,"&mdash;their dirty blanket,
and raw beef tied on their backs, and no other clothing
than a checked cotton shirt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
ATTACK ON THE WATERKLOOF&mdash;SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONS.</h2>


<p>From the daily reports brought in from all sides, it
appeared that the enemy was concentrating a large force,
and that greater or less bodies frequently made their
way through secret bush-paths by night from the Amatolas
to the much discussed Waterkloof, so that it was
with more pleasure than surprise that we received, on the
11th October, a sudden order for a general movement
of the troops against that stronghold.</p>

<p>Next morning, a little before daylight, General
Somerset left the camp with the Artillery and Cape
Corps for the junction of the Mancazana and Kat Rivers,
where he was to be joined by Lieut.-Col. Michell's Brigade
(the 2nd, 6th, and 91st regiments, with two field
pieces), marching from Fort Hare the same morning.</p>

<p>The next day they were to ascend the Blinkwater
hills from the Kat River valley, and encamp on the
heights north of the Waterkloof, to be in readiness to
co-operate with the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Division by
dawn of the 14th.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock on the night of the same day the
General's party started, the 2nd Brigade under Lieut.-Col.
Fordyce, consisting of the reserve battalion, 12th regiment,
the 74th Highlanders, a squadron of Mounted
Irregulars, and two companies of Fingoes, in all about
1150 men, marched through the silent moonlit streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of Beaufort, and crossing the bridge took the Klu-Klu
road, halting after about fourteen miles march,
at the Yellow-wood River; resting three hours, we
again marched for the Goba River, five miles further.
The heat of the sun was intense, and the barrels of our
rifles and pistols became so hot that we could not bear
to place the hand on them.</p>

<p>On reaching the foot of the Kroome, at the point of
ascent, the men were ordered to rest till night, and all
lay down under the grateful shade of the bushes. Our
guide, it appeared, knew nothing of the pass by which
he proposed taking us up the mountain; some said it
was totally impracticable at any time for horses, and at
night almost so for infantry; it was therefore determined
to take another path more to the westward.</p>

<p>In the evening, a cold rain succeeded the hot day,
and we lay shivering on the ground a confused mass of
steaming blankets. A little before midnight we were
roused for the march. Comfortless as our rest had been,
it was with the greatest reluctance we crept out of our
plaids and blankets into the bitterly cold foggy air and
drizzling rain, to stumble drowsily along our night-march.</p>

<p>The Kroome rose black and frowning before us, its
summit hidden in heavy clouds, which added to its apparent
height. The ascent soon became so steep that the
mounted men had to alight, and we were in momentary
fear that the pack-horses would come to grief. No one
who has not felt his entire subsistence for many days
to be dependant on a slight accident&mdash;the turning of a
pack-saddle, the falling of the horse, or the bâtman's
awkwardness at some critical moment, can imagine the
painful interest with which the ascent or descent of a
difficult pass is regarded.</p>

<p>The first ridge gained, we moved along a grassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
level for some distance, the greater part of us more
than half asleep, and staggering along like drunken
men; every now and then, as some sudden inequality
endangered our balance, awaking with a start, again
relapsing into a state of somnambulism, which was as
painful as it was irresistible; the grassy path assumed
the appearance of a carpet, of which I could distinctly
trace the pattern; rocks and bushes became beds, chairs,
and chests of drawers, which stood round distinct as
reality; until with a stumble and a start, consciousness
returned, the illusions vanished, and I still found myself
plodding along with the same wearying tramp, tramp.
This strange sensation was experienced by most of us,
at different times, during our long and harassing forced
marches by night; and for my own part, so unpleasant
did I find it, that in trying to shake it off, I pinched my
arms black and blue.</p>

<p>As day began to dawn, and we reached the higher
ranges, the scene around and below was grandly desolate;
the steep slopes we had ascended looked bare and
black in the indistinct light; and the dark summits
on every side appeared, and were lost again in the
floating clouds.</p>

<p>The column, clambering up the steep laborious path,
looked like flies swarming on the heights. The horses
panted for breath; and the men were quite "pumped,"
having been marching two whole nights.</p>

<p>The summit gained, we halted on a burnt and
blackened table-land, where we were facetiously ordered
to breakfast, having nothing with us but black biscuit,
which we sat down on the dewy ground to gnaw at.</p>

<p>A thick heavy cloud or fog hung around; so dense
as to hide everything at a few yards distance, saturating
our canvas blouses, and striking so chilly that we were
heartily glad to move on again, after waiting two hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in vain for a glimpse of the General's column; it had,
however, one advantage; enabling us to take up our
position unseen, and totally unsuspected by the enemy,
whose attention was occupied with the movements of
the other Brigade.</p>

<p>At half-past seven we moved forward along the
grassy undulating ridge, with flank-patrols thrown out
right and left, and had not proceeded a quarter of a mile
when the boom of a gun indicated the direction of the
co-operating division; and almost immediately afterwards,
through an opening in the driving clouds, we
caught sight of the red coats and gleaming arms
moving along the heights on the opposite side of the
sunny valley, towards its head. The howitzers belched
out their white smoke, and we saw a couple of shells
burst over a Kaffir village; the cavalry moved rapidly
forward, the battalion following, and again all was hidden
in the mist. The rattle of small arms, and the occasional
roar of the big guns told they were actively engaged;
and, continuing for some time, created no little impatience
and excitement amongst us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we had advanced about seven miles; and
halting, piled arms near the spot where we had been
attacked on the 8th of September, and about three-quarters
of a mile from the belt of bush in front, separating
us from the other division. Several companies of
the 12th and 74th were extended, lying down to watch
the forest, in case any of the enemy should attempt to
escape from it: and detached parties of Fingoes were
sent into the bush on the right, where they set fire to
a number of huts, and with their usual activity, kept
up an uninterrupted firing for a quarter of an hour, at
some fifteen or twenty Kaffirs. The horses were off-saddled,
and turned out to graze, not having had any
food since the previous night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>After we had lain in this way for rather more than
an hour, a party of the 91st, and Cape Corps was seen
issuing from the forest, and an officer galloped forward
with an order from the General for our brigade to join
him. The picquets were instantly called in, and while
the horses were being saddled, we crowded to learn
news of the other column. They had had some severe
fighting, and had driven a large body of the enemy from
their position on the forest heights, into the Blinkwater
and Waterkloof, though not without loss. Captain
Addison, of the 2nd Queen's, had been severely wounded,
Lieutenant Norris of the 6th mortally, two or three men
killed or wounded, and Lieut.-Col. Burn's charger shot
under him.</p>

<p>On entering the belt of wood, passable only by a narrow
rocky path, we had to march in file. The timber was
very fine, with luxuriant evergreens beneath, immense
creepers and baboon-ropes hanging in festoons, or
pendant to the ground, from branches fifty or sixty feet
high.</p>

<p>The rear of our column had nearly gained the other
side of the belt, from which the head had already
emerged, when a sudden volley from a dark thicket
above us made the forest ring, while the balls whistled
past our heads and struck the trees on the opposite
side the path, sending splinters flying on every side. We
continued advancing, firing at every puff of smoke, the
only indication of the whereabouts of our hidden enemy,
until we gained the open, when we were saluted by
a succession of volleys from an angle of the forest on our
left, especially directed at each officer as he came up,
though fortunately, without doing further injury than
grazing a few of the men's accoutrements.</p>

<p>We were moving along the open to join the General,
when an alarm was given that the 12th regiment, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
rear, with the pack horses, was cut off in the pass. Our
companies, just formed into open column, were ordered
to the right about, and sent back again at "the double"
to extend along the edge of the wood; when a very
pretty skirmish took place; our men sheltered by the
rocky ground, and the enemy dodging behind the trees
and firing from breastworks of loose stones, thrown up
in front of their village, along the edge of the forest.
Under cover of our fire the 12th cleared the pass,
bearing a wounded man with them; half a dozen of
our mounted men were wounded, and several riderless
horses galloped wildly past. The artillery, posted on a
rising ground, about a quarter of a mile in our rear,
opened on the bush, wherever the Kaffirs showed themselves
in parties, and sent round shot and "spherical
case" right in amongst them, whirring and <i>hurtling</i>
over our heads with an astounding, and, at first, rather
startling noise, splintering the trees and killing all
within their deadly range. In the hottest of the fire,
poor Ricketts, of the 91st, was carried past us, dangerously
wounded in the chest. After a sharp skirmish, of
about a quarter of an hour, the enemy's fire was completely
silenced, and the wood apparently totally deserted;&mdash;the
"recall" sounded, the skirmishers closed and
retired, the regiments were re-formed, and the heavy
masses of infantry, moving from all sides across the green
flat, joined the General's party.</p>

<p>Having formed open column, we moved off across
an extensive undulating table-land of the brightest
green, extending for miles on every side, and bounded
only by the distant peaks of the surrounding mountains.
Far in front rode the reconnoitering party of
irregular horse; then came the advance-guard of
infantry, followed by the prisoners, carrying their
pots, mats, and calabashes on their heads; then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sad train of wounded officers and men, borne on
stretchers&mdash;Addison, Norris, and Ricketts, and a dozen
more brave fellows; the long, steadily waving column&mdash;the
2nd Queen's; the stained and ragged 6th;
the newly-arrived 12th, with their bright coats; the
74th Highlanders, in their service-like bush-dress;
the gallant 91st; the lumbering artillery; the Cape
Mounted Rifles; and a whole troop of pack-horses
and mules.</p>

<p>Our retiring was the signal for the enemy to reappear,
which they instantly did, following us out on
the open plain, taking up every point of cover, and firing
long shots, but we took no notice of them until they
were drawn out far enough, when the cavalry charged
them under Captain Carey, riding over and cutting
them down right and left, wheeling round, and charging
them again and again till they were totally dispersed.</p>

<p>Thoroughly exhausted, and scarcely able to drag ourselves
over the last few yards, we halted at five in the
evening, at Mundell's, a deserted farm in a hollow of
the plain, after being under arms for nearly twenty
hours, and without food.</p>

<p>One of our men, foot-sore and done up, who had
fallen to the rear and got into the ranks of another
regiment, was reported missing, but shortly afterwards
limping into camp, abused his comrades right and
left, for having thought him dead.</p>

<p>A mounted body of the enemy made their appearance
a little before sunset, on a low hill, about a mile off,
and went through a series of regular cavalry movements
for our edification; unluckily they were out of range,
and our horses and oxen, which had worked fasting
since daylight, were just turned out to graze, otherwise
they would have been treated to a round shot.</p>

<p>The wounded men had been placed in waggons to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
sent to Post Retief, a small fort, about fifteen miles
distant, but by the time they were ready to start it was
getting too late, and as parties of the enemy's horsemen
were hovering round, it was deferred till the morrow.
Poor Norris, who had been rapidly sinking during the
evening, died a little before "tattoo." His loss was
deeply felt by his regiment and all who knew him.</p>

<p>Our bivouac was in a little hollow, and close to a detached
piece of bush, where we found the bones of an elephant
shot there a few years before. The camp fires looked
singularly beautiful by night, scattered up and down the
hill, and glowing among the trees of the little belt of
wood in which our regiment had taken up its quarters.</p>

<p>All next day we remained in this spot, awaiting a
fresh supply of ammunition from Post Retief. Numbers
of mounted Kaffirs again made their appearance, and
went through similar evolutions, but at a very respectful
distance. In the afternoon we buried poor Norris, at
the edge of the wood. It was an affecting scene. The
corpse lay by the side of the open grave, sewn up in a
blanket, through which oozed the blood from his death wound;
around stood uncovered a reverent crowd of
officers and men; grey-headed Colonels, and a host of
younger bronzed and weather-beaten faces, in stained
and tattered uniform; the soldier-like looking old
General, with his snow-white hair and drooping grey
moustache; the "funeral party" of the 6th, their red coats
patched with leather, canvas, and cloth of all colours,
with straw hats and wide-awakes, long beards, tattered
trowsers, and broken boots revealing stockingless feet,
leaning their sun-burnt cheeks on the butts of their
"arms reversed," while the clergyman (the Rev. J.
Wilson), who had ridden over from Post Retief with a
small escort, to perform the last rites for one whom he
had known in life, read the beautiful funeral service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with unusual feeling. Scarcity of ammunition prevented
the customary volleys being fired over the grave, and we
turned away and dispersed in silence. Thus ended the
brief but honourable career of a gallant young soldier,
beloved and admired by all for his high principles and
amiable qualities.</p>

<p>The General rode out afterwards with his Staff and
escort to reconnoitre the enemy's position, and soon
after his return orders were issued for the march at two
o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark and bitterly cold, when we rose
from our short rest, and we did not, for some reason or
other, move off for more than an hour. At length
Lieut.-Colonel Fordyce's brigade (12th, 74th, and 91st
regiments, with four companies of Native Levies) moved
towards the Bush Neck Pass, and a large Kaffir signal
fire blazed up on the heights before us, no doubt
announcing our approach to those in the valley, into
which we soon began a difficult descent by a rocky and
tremendously steep pass, slipping from rock to rock in
the uncertain light of the grey dawn, or sliding in a
sitting posture down the sheer gravelly face.</p>

<p>The valley at last reached, we halted for a few
minutes (till the pack-horses and mules in rear scrambled
down after us) near a solitary farm-house, a burnt
and blackened ruin, with a fine garden full of vines,
bananas, orange, lemon, citron, pomegranate, fig, peach,
and almond trees, their blossom scenting the morning
air. A drizzling rain came on, and we continued our
march up the beautifully wooded valley, which was shut
in by high mountains, half covered by the fleecy
clouds resting on their bush-covered heights, the broad
path, cut through a perfect grove of flowering bushes,
followed the course of a winding rocky burn up the
centre of the glen. As we advanced, the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
were varied by grey crags, fine belts of lichen-covered
forest, and soft smooth slopes of the greenest grass; the
rain gradually ceased, and the clouds slowly lifted,
revealing lofty krantzes of basaltic rock rising perpendicularly
from the dark bush that clothed the higher
ridges; the large forest trees on the summit appearing
against the clear blue sky like a fringe of small shrubs.
The sun at length broke through the clouds, and the bush,
sparkling with dew drops, scented the air with its
fragrance. Parts of the road were so strikingly like a
park at home that one almost expected at each turn to
come in sight of the house.</p>

<p>Along each side of the path, and close to the bush,
we found, as we proceeded, the dead bodies of many of
the enemy killed in the engagement of the 14th; clouds
of flies rose with a startling buzz from the corpses, which
lay literally broiling in the hot sun, some on their faces
in the long grass, others with their swollen features
exposed, and legs drawn up, while a few lay half-reclining
under the trees, as though they had died there
of their wounds; most were partially eaten by jackals
and hyænas, whose spoor was traceable all round;
eighteen lay in this way along our path, and the horrible
stench in many places told that others were concealed by
the dense underwood; among others, was an enormous
"Bastaard" Hottentot, who must have been nearly six
feet three.</p>

<p>The melancholy ruins of two more farm-houses were
passed, levelled with the ground; the fine orchards, in
full blossom, contrasting strangely with the forsaken
appearance of the blackened heaps of what had been
happy and comfortable homes. At the entrance of
another valley running into this, on our right, we found
the fresh spoor of horses, cattle and sheep, leading
along the sandy path that ran up its centre. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
column was halted, and a mounted force, with three
companies of the 74th, was detached to follow it, while
the rest remained at the point of separation. Some
cattle were seen on the hills, about a mile in advance,
and we pushed on up the glen as quickly as possible;
but after tracing the spoor for two miles, it disappeared
in twenty different directions, leading into an impracticable
bushy gorge, and as the Colonel did not think
it advisable to follow it further, and so delay our great
object of clearing the Waterkloof, we returned to the
main body.</p>

<p>We now got a sight of the General's column on the
opposite heights, moving along the ridge like a train of
ants. As we proceeded, they reached the enemy's
position just above us, and opened fire from the
howitzers; the rolling boom, and the report of bursting
shells, was followed by the faint rattle of small arms, from
the 2nd and 6th regiments, which through the glass
we could distinguish along the edge of the precipice.</p>

<p>Our Irregulars were extended and sent into the bush,
to the right and left, climbing to a great height up the
hills, working beautifully through the thick forests, and
completely scouring it up to the base of the krantzes,
setting fire to a number of huts hidden in the thickest
retreats; the effect of the blue wreaths of smoke curling
up above the tops of the trees in the higher forest after
each rolling report; the thick white smoke rising from
the burning huts; and the echoing of the Fingoes' peculiar
cries, far up on the heights, with the shrill voices of
captured women, was most singular. Two companies of
the reserve battalion of the 91st regiment were extended
across the valley, advancing through the scattered bush
in line with the Levies on the mountains; the 12th regiment,
and the 74th Highlanders, with the mounted force,
following by the road in the centre, in column of sections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
None of the enemy were to be seen, beyond a few single
individuals far out of rifle range, perched on lofty crags,
which appeared quite inaccessible, and we proceeded
up the kloof, destroying their huts without opposition.
Along the base of the northern range, and at the edge
of the forest, sheltered under its overhanging trees, were
numbers of kraals neatly built of reeds, and plastered
with mud; immediately in front spread a smooth green,
separated from the road by the rocky stream, whose
beautifully clear waters bubbled over the stones with a
most refreshing sound; a more delightful and picturesque
situation for a village could not be found. It had
evidently only just been abandoned, for in most of the
huts we found fires smouldering on the centre of the
mud floors; in some, half-ground coffee lay on the flat
grinding stones (proving the fact of their obtaining town
supplies); calabashes and sheep-skin rugs were in all,
while the large quantities of freshly chewed root showed
that a considerable number of Kaffirs must have been
there very recently. The whole of these dwellings, built
on the property of the ruined farmers, whose sacked and
gutted houses we had passed, were set fire to, and in a
few minutes, roaring and crackling, sent up their flames
high above the shrivelling trees; the whole glen behind,
as we entered the narrow pass at its head, was smoking
as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>The ascent from the valley was by a very steep, rocky
path, cut through a cool shady forest, leading straight up
the face of the mountain, and only wide enough in many
places to admit the men in single file; the underwood
was choked up with an endless variety of luxuriant
shrubs, entwined with the sweet scented wild vine,
baboon-ropes of extraordinary length hanging from the
topmost branches of the lofty, bare poled trees, which in
some places met overhead, and in others showed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
narrow strip of the bright blue sky above. In the
thicket, full of wood anemones and bright flowers, lay
the dead bodies of one or two more Kaffirs, exhibiting
frightful wounds from the splinters of a shell.</p>

<p>Felled trees lay across the path to obstruct our
passage, but the General's column at the head of
the pass, and the simultaneous advance of the Fingoes
as flank-skirmishers, one party sweeping round
the head of the valley on our right, and another clearing
the bush on the left, secured our ascent without
opposition, till just at the summit, when the head of the
brigade having gained the open field or "Horseshoe"
(so called from its shape, enclosed by forest), the rear-guard,
consisting of the 12th reserve, a company of the
74th, and the mounted men, was sharply attacked from
the bush on their left, the Kaffirs after firing a volley
rushing out with their assegais. One man of the 74th was
killed and one wounded; Gordon, bravely rushing back
to his rescue as he was left struggling on the ground
with four or five of the savages, shot one of them dead
with his pistol, and wounded another, when a few of the
men running up, drove off or killed the rest, and carried
away the wounded man, whose appearance gave but
little hope of recovery, his face being frightfully cut with
assegais, and his skull battered by the blows from the
butt end of a gun. At the edge of the forest we set fire
to a cluster of huts, larger and differently shaped from
any we had seen before, and faced with smooth shining
reeds; they were believed to belong to Macomo.</p>

<p>On emerging from the bush we found the artillery,
the 2nd and 6th regiments and the Cape Mounted
Rifles on the ground, and the enemy showing in considerable
force on some low rocks on our right, whence
they opened fire on us at long range. One man of the
12th was wounded, and one of the mounted men, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
horse was also killed. Our brigade "formed line to
the right," and lay under cover of a ridge, two companies
of the 74th and two of the 91st advancing in
skirmishing order towards the forest in front, from
which the rebels kept up a hot fire, the bullets falling
thickly among us. From this position they were quickly
driven, and the General bringing two of the guns under
Lieutenant Field to bear on the rocks, drove them out
of that one also, the shells falling among them with
wonderful precision.</p>

<p>It was now about two o'clock, and the Waterkloof
having been cleared below, and the enemy driven from
their positions on the heights, we were ordered to join
the other column under Lieut.-Col. Michell, who had
attacked and destroyed the whole of the enemy's camps
along the ridge. On our way, the Kaffirs suddenly
opened fire on us from a narrow belt of forest on the left;
the skirmishers of the 2nd brigade were again thrown
forward, a sharp fire ensuing on both sides. A large
ball, weighing about three ounces, striking a piece of
rock on which I stood, with a loud whirring, lodged perfectly
flattened in a small crevice under my feet; and at
the same moment one of our men fell severely wounded.
The 6th regiment reinforced our line of skirmishers;
part of the 74th charged into the little belt of bush; the
Kaffirs bolted into the dense thickets of the main forest,
throwing away their guns, and we re-formed in extended
order on the open green on the other side, under fire
from a second forest in front, towards which we rapidly
advanced. The Kaffirs were seen in several of the
largest trees further from the edge of the bush, from
which they kept up a hot fire as we approached, and the
bullets whistled over our heads much more thickly than
was quite pleasant; another private of the 74th Highlanders
was shot dead, one of the 12th wounded, four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
men of the 91st were severely wounded, two men of the
Levies killed, and two wounded, with four or five horses
killed and disabled. The bush was entered at "the
double," and the belt cleared as before; several of the
enemy, who were chiefly "Totties," armed with double
barrel carbines, being shot, the rest escaping down the
mountain, under cover of the thick forest, impenetrable
to our soldiers. Not a living creature was to be seen,
and the bugle sounding the recall, we returned and
formed column on the open ground; and bearing our
killed and wounded on stretchers, and marshalling our
prisoners, marched at four o'clock for our bivouac of
the previous night, moving across the open flat, as on
the former occasion; with two guns, the 2nd, and 6th
regiments, and Cape Corps as a rear-guard, under Lieut.-Col.
Michell.</p>

<p>We had not gone more than three quarters of a mile,
when from the very bush we had just left apparently
totally deserted, some fifteen or twenty Kaffirs issued;
and running forward, fired half a dozen shots after us,
which fell some two or three hundred yards short. In
less than a minute one of the guns was unlimbered and
a shell sent among them, killing several, and so alarming
the rest, that they fled in every direction, and disappeared
in the bush. Late in the evening we approached
our old position, and saw, to our surprise, a party of dismounted
horsemen apparently awaiting our arrival. On
coming up, we found them to be a party of Burghers
from the Mancazana district. Wearied and exhausted
as the men were after this long and trying day, they
busied themselves at once in looking after the comfort
of their wounded comrades, who had the hospital-tent
pitched, and everything done for them that was possible;
though a single blanket on the hard ground with a canteen
for a pillow, or a large stone with a pocket handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
over it, was a poor bed for a wounded or dying
man, and we had nothing better to give them.</p>

<p>A mounted party was sent off to Post Retief, to order
commissariat supplies to meet us at our halting place
the following evening. The women and children taken
prisoners were examined by the Interpreter, but no reliable
information could be obtained, and they were set
at liberty at dusk. The Fingoes, washing down at a
little stream beyond the camp, slily watching their opportunity,
ran after them hooting and hissing and pelting
them as they ran. Having fed our own horses, and
picketted them for the night, we rolled ourselves in our
plaids, and with the saddles under our heads, were soon
sound asleep.</p>

<p>At five o'clock next morning, in a thick fog, we buried
the poor fellows killed the day before, digging their
graves at the edge of the little clump of trees, a few yards
from that of poor Norris; the service was read by the officer-of-the-day,
and large wood fires were made over all the
graves for the purpose of scaring away the wolves and
jackals after we had gone, and of hiding the position
from the Kaffirs. At seven o'clock we marched, the
clouds still resting on the heights, cold and raw, and
preventing our seeing more than the ground we walked
on; after five miles they gradually dispersed, and we
halted at the edge of a small detached belt of forest,
and encamped under it, close to the ruins of a farm
house, of which but a very small portion of the outer
walls remained standing, having been destroyed by the
Kaffirs nine months before, since which it had never
been visited. We found the skeleton of its former owner,
Mr. Eastland, who was barbarously murdered by Hermanus'
Kaffirs, and some others residing with him on
his own farm. They had surprised him in his house, and
after some parleying through the closed door, got him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
outside and killed him on the spot; after stealing all
they cared for, they set fire to the premises. We collected
the remains of the unfortunate man, and carefully
buried them in his own garden.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers, who, as usual, after divesting
themselves of their accoutrements, had gone into the
bush for firewood, to our surprise came running out,
saying it was full of Kaffirs. A party of us seized our
arms, spread ourselves across it at one end (it was not
more than 500 yards by 900), and having placed parties
at each angle, advanced through the underwood. Three
Kaffirs were killed, which proved to be the whole party,
evidently spies, who had been cut off by our unexpectedly
halting here,&mdash;the level open nature of the ground, extending
for miles on every side of the isolated wood,
preventing their making a retreat.</p>

<p>After having been several days without a possibility
of changing or removing our clothes, we greatly enjoyed
a wash in some muddy pools, in spite of the tepid waters
and the quantities of immense bull frogs which we surprised
basking on the slimy reedy banks.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, after our customary
simple toilet and breakfast, that is to say, after pulling
on a dirty pair of boots, and swallowing a tin of thick
coffee, the 2nd brigade marched for Beaufort, to bring
commissariat supplies, descending the Blinkwater Pass.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the war a party of Winterberg
settlers, returning to their mountain farms from
Fort Beaufort, were attacked here by the Kaffirs; two
of them were killed, and their heads cut off and sent to
the witch-doctor, Umlangeni; and two were dangerously
wounded, one in seven places, who escaped only by remaining
till dusk immersed up to his chin in the river
among the reeds. The Pass is a rough and almost impracticable
waggon road, winding down the mountain
side through thick forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>A magnificent perpendicular krantz or precipice, on
our right, of immense height, completely commanding
the road below, was crowned by the 2nd and 6th and
artillery, while two guns, guarded by a detachment of
Cape Corps, cleared the way before us, throwing shell
from the heights on our left down into the forest, in a
nook of which, snugly embosomed, lay a Kaffir kraal,
which, together with several scattered huts, the Fingoes
set on fire as they scoured through the bush. This fertile
valley, now totally deserted, was formerly the location
of the Gaika chief, Hermanus, or Hermanus Matross,
who, it will be recollected, was killed in his attack on
Fort Beaufort.</p>

<p>The Kaffirs, who had on our approach fled from the
kraal, stood watching us from a rock, from which they
were quickly driven by a shell, thrown over our heads
right amongst them. After our warm march we luxuriated
in a bathe in the river, on the banks of which, and
close to the ruins of an old military post, we had made
our bivouac; and having washed our own shirts, and
dried them on the hot rocks, felt more comfortable than
we had done for many days.</p>

<p>Kaffir fires on the heights above Hermanus' Kloof and
Fuller's Hoek smoked till dusk, when their ruddy light
became visible, and blazed brightly all night.</p>

<p>The following day we remained stationary, waiting for
the supplies. The clouds came creeping down the hills
all around, as if to envelop us, and ended in heavy rain,
which continued steadily pouring down all the afternoon
and evening. As we had not even patrol-tents, we sat
crouching round the miserable fires in our steaming
cloaks, mingling the smoke of our pipes with the heavy
wreaths from the damp wood fires, which, circling and
eddying round, filled our eyes with tears, giving us altogether,
with our dripping forage-caps and damp clothes,
a ridiculously forlorn aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>After a final pull from the flask of "Cape-smoke," to
keep out the cold, we spread our plaids on the sloppy
ground, which, at all events, had the advantage of being
much softer than usual, and with a few green branches
stuck into the turf to keep the wet off our saddle pillows,
rolled ourselves up, and, in defiance of the rain, slept till
daybreak.</p>

<p>19th.&mdash;Stiff and cold with the wet in which we had
lain all night, we awoke at four. The 12th and 74th,
under Lieut.-Col. Perceval, marched at five to meet the
supplies coming from Fort Beaufort, leaving a party behind
in bivouac with the pack-horses. The rain cleared
off shortly after we had started, and our clothes soon
dried on our backs. The General on the Waterkloof
heights, with Lieut.-Col. Michell's Brigade, was occupying
this interval in reconnoitering the enemy's positions,
preparatory to further operations on our return.</p>

<p>We halted within sight of Fort Beaufort, about a mile
and a half distant, to wait for the waggons coming up;
a few of us having got leave to ride in to obtain a few
necessaries for our prolonged patrol, on condition we
were back again with the waggons, set off at full gallop,
meeting them, to our great annoyance, about half way,
and escorted by a reinforcement of the 12th and a fresh
draft from the depôt, under Lieutenant Philpot; hastily
welcoming him to the Cape, and begging the officer in
command of the escort not to distress the oxen by pushing
on too fast! we sped on our way, for we were only half
a mile from the town, and there was no likelihood of our
having such a chance again for weeks. We were soon
rattling up the quiet streets of Beaufort, a most ruffianly-looking
party, with rusted rifles, mud-caked horses,
bronzed unshaven faces, and tattered clothes, torn to
shreds in the thorny bush. To our surprise, we found
the fashionably-dressed inhabitants going to church, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
we had no idea of its being Sunday. The barracks were
all in confusion, the 60th Rifles having just arrived, together
with detachments of the 12th and 45th regiments,
a strong body of Marines from the men-of-war on the coast,
and a party of Sappers and Miners, in all about 1000
men; so there was nothing to be had there in the way of
food. Dunbar, however, kindly took us to his quarters,
and gave us such a breakfast as we had not seen for
many a day; and as we sat on chairs round the well-spread
table, with its snowy cloth, we felt as if we were
in a dream, though we helped ourselves in a very wide-awake
manner. Having each secured in the town whatever
we could lay hands on, to take back to our less fortunate
comrades, we returned full gallop. I had got a
couple of loaves in my haversac, with an enormous
cabbage, and a bottle of brandy. We overtook the
waggons just as the last one had come up to the Colonel's
party, and they were preparing to move forward.</p>

<p>An unusual number of Hottentot women accompanied
the train; and as of late their conduct had excited much
suspicion in Beaufort as well as in the field (for numbers
infest all the camps, a nuisance to everybody but the
Cape Corps men and waggon-drivers, from whom they
are inseparable), the Colonel had made some inquiries
as to their movements; and obtaining very unsatisfactory
replies, ordered them to be searched by the Fingoes, who
set to work at once with a mischievous alacrity. To the
indignation of all, quantities of ammunition were found
secreted in their bundles and on their persons, for the
undoubted purpose of being clandestinely conveyed to
the Rebels. On one woman ninety-five rounds of government
ammunition were found; on another, eighty; others
had smaller quantities; and one carried a canister of
loose powder, and a bullet-mould and turnscrew. They
must either have stolen or obtained the ball-cartridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from the Hottentots at Beaufort in government pay;
and how and to what extent the practice was carried on,
became a question of serious consideration. It was with
the greatest difficulty the women were rescued from the
infuriated Fingoes, who would have assegaied them on
the spot but for the interference of the officers; they
were sent back prisoners to Beaufort. By these wretches
the enemy was provided, not only with means for destroying
us, but of keeping themselves in absolute comfort.
Ammunition and food it was accidentally found had been
regularly forwarded to them by the Tottie women of our
own camps, fed, by the way, at the government expense,
who, under pretence of collecting firewood in the bush,
hid their supplies in certain assigned spots, whence
they were to be secretly taken away at night by the
rebels.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon our long train reached the
bivouac in torrents of rain, which again poured down
with a steady relentlessness that soon flooded the camp,
and we made up our minds for another wet night. On
rising, at three o'clock next morning, we found little
pools of water collected in the hollows indented in the
soft ground by our hips and shoulders. We fell in, and
stood for half an hour in the ranks ankle deep in the
mud, waiting for the waggons to move on, shivering
like men with ague, our fingers so benumbed that we
could scarcely hold our rifles. After creeping along for
about half a mile we came to a complete stand-still at a
small rise, the road being too slippery for the oxen, which
cannot draw on wet ground, and we had to return to our
bivouac once more.</p>

<p>Here we remained all day in the incessant rain,
<i>slushing</i> about in the mud, and trying to keep our feet
warm by pacing up and down as on board ship, for it
was not safe in the thick fog to venture far enough from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the camp for a walk. We busied ourselves also in trying
to make the fires burn better; collecting stones, and
building them up so as to raise the wood from the
flooded ground. A cloaked and dripping cavalry express
enveloped in steam, arrived in the afternoon from the
Heights with a letter from the General, to know why we
had not marched, as the covering party at the top of the
pass had been waiting for us several hours. Shortly
afterwards a second equally damp party came in with a
despatch, "to be forwarded immediately" to Fort Beaufort,
ordering the 60th Rifles to move to the Blinkwater
the following day.</p>

<p>Next morning we made another attempt to get the
waggons off, but after an hour's work had only got about
200 yards from the bivouac, and continued for the next
three to crawl along at this snail's pace, suffering very
much in our thin clothing from the frost. On entering
the foot of the pass at its upper end a party of Kaffirs,
perched on the summit of an isolated sugarloaf hill on
our left, shouted to us, "<i>Nina Ez'innqulo ez'ingafanela
ukuze apa kanjako kulendhlela leyo!</i>" (You
Tortoise warriors had better not again attempt to come
by this path.) Every word being perfectly distinct,
though at first we could barely distinguish their forms;
then they upbraided the Fingoes, "<i>Nina Amafingo
yinina ukuba niya silwa tina? Gokuba nina ezisicthloba
zetu kanjaka sasimika amazimba nemasi kumi,
nokuba nina inyabulala sina jeninja.</i>" (Why, Fingoes,
do you fight against your friends? We gave you corn,
and plenty of sour milk, and you fire at us as though
we were dogs.) The ready retort, sung out with measured
distinctness was, "<i>Waza wapendula amanfingo,
nina Amaxoso hiyenza amaqoboka tina into ufanela
ukuba womtu wa nika uku 'dhle kwamasheshi ake,
asibulela tina</i>." (You made us your slaves, Kaffirs;
a man must feed his horse; we do not thank you.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
We desired our spokesman to inform them that if
they intended to prevent the white faces coming
that way they had better be prepared at once, for
another war party was coming the same path to-morrow;
to this they replied by firing a shot at us, which fell
among the bushes a few paces short; a long shot, even
for a Dutch roer, which from the report we had no doubt
it was. Many of these heavy clumsy-looking weapons
carry a four-ounce ball, and are of enormous length and
weight. The nominal charge of powder is as much as
will cover the ball placed on the flat palm of the hand,
but as it is poured by guess out of the rough cow-horn
powder-flask it generally exceeds even this liberal
allowance, and if it does not dislocate the shooter's
shoulder, or knock him down, seldom fails to send him
reeling. On this challenge several of our long range
rifles were immediately brought to bear on the group;
Baird's, a heavy metalled 'polygroove,' by Dickson, of
Edinburgh, throwing a ball right amongst them at a
distance of at least 1200 yards, the effect of which was
most absurd; one fellow, who had been standing conspicuously
in a dark red blanket, throwing himself flat
on his face, and the rest jumping right and left with uncommon
agility. They fired several more shots at us,
and Bruce, Gordon, and myself, each in turn brought
our rifles to bear on them, completely silencing their
conversation as well as the fire.</p>

<p>The wheezing oxen having recovered their breath for
another spell, the creaking waggons again moved slowly
on, and halting every five or ten yards, toiled wearily
up the steep ascent, the slippery road constantly bringing
a whole team on their knees in their efforts to move
their load; so tedious was our progress that we were
fourteen hours performing these eight miles. When
about half-way up the Pass, at a turn in the road, we
saw that "the krantz" was held by a strong party of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the other brigade posted to cover our ascent, the red
coats of the 6th and 91st appearing like specks along its
lofty precipitous edge, peeping from among the bush and
huge masses of rock some hundreds of feet above us.
The heat of the sun in the narrow road, shut in between
thick forest, was intense, and told fearfully against the
cattle. We had barely gained the top of the Pass by
three o'clock, and with the exception of a single cup of
coffee, at two in the morning, had not yet broken our
fast, for unfortunately none of us had any biscuit in our
haversacs, as it was "ration day," and we had expected
to gain the top of the hill for breakfast. I was, however,
lucky enough to get a few raisins from a dirty but generous
Dutchman, to the envy of the less favoured. When
we had fairly gained the open flat above, the covering
party of artillery and infantry was withdrawn, and
formed our rear-guard, and in a couple of hours more
we reached the camp, far more fatigued by the slow
creeping pace and constant halting than we should
have been by a long day's march, and were so hungry
and tired that we could not wait for anything being
cooked. As for myself, having secured a lead-like loaf
of camp manufacture, I devoured the whole of it, and
fell asleep on the grass.</p>

<p>It took us all next day to get the commissariat supplies
distributed and the empty waggons escorted down
the hill again to the Blinkwater. A sudden stir was
caused in camp through one of the guard-fires having
been incautiously made without the usual precaution of
clearing a space in the long dry grass, which took fire;
in a few minutes a large extent was blazing furiously.
Independently of the danger to our camp, the loss of
pasture was a serious consideration. The General was
in a furious rage, and instantly ordered every one in
camp to assist in putting it out. In a few minutes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
whole brigade appeared on the ground, armed with green
boughs, and spread over the smoking plain, switching
away most vigorously at the blazing grass; luckily
there was no wind, and it was very soon extinguished,
though not before several acres were burnt
black, and one face of the camp thrown into the greatest
confusion by the hasty removal of the ammunition,
blankets, piles of arms, and patrol-tents, from the way
of the spreading conflagration. In moving the muskets,
one of them went off accidentally, the ball striking the
tent in which the General was sitting, with several of his
officers; rather astonishing the party within.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23rd, Lieut.-Col. Michell's
Brigade marched from camp for the Blinkwater valley
below, to be in readiness to ascend the Heights by
Fullers Hoek at daylight the following morning, and
assail the enemy's position from that quarter, simultaneously
with the attack of the 60th Rifles from the
Wolfsback range on the other, and Lieut.-Col. Fordyce's
direct on their front. In the evening orders were
issued for the march before daylight; it was a dark cold
morning, and we were enveloped in the chilly mist as
we moved along the ridge, until day broke, when the
clouds lifting we got fine views of the valleys below,
lighted up with the morning sun. Some Kaffir horses,
which had been grazing during the night, and had been
left out longer than usual, were seen near the edge of
the bush, and some of our horsemen, after a short
chevy, captured them, a few shots being fired at the
party out of the thick fog. Soon after, a body of Kaffirs
was observed making across the open, for the forest above
the Waterkloof, about half a mile distant on our right,
and the 74th immediately gave chase; the horse guns
and Cape Corps galloped to an eminence on our left,
and fired several rounds of shell into another body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
assembled on a ridge, leading down into the Blinkwater,
to oppose the ascent of Lieut.-Col. Nesbitt's force, which
was steadily ascending the steep face of the hill under
fire, driving the enemy from point to point. We advanced
rapidly in extended order towards the forest, and
in a few minutes were warmly engaged with the enemy,
who were strongly posted in the rocks among the trees,
one of our men being shot dead at the first volley.
Entering the wood, we drove them before us till they
were lost in impenetrable underwood; the 12th and
Fingo Levies covering our movement as we brought
right shoulders forward, in direction of the village at
the head of the Pass, near the old sawpits, where the
enemy had posted themselves, and were with some difficulty
dislodged. Colonel Fordyce sent me, with half-a-dozen
volunteers, to set fire to the village, which we had
great difficulty in effecting, owing to the huts being perfectly
green, and during the operation were annoyed by
firing from the wood. The regiment held on through
the forest, driving the enemy step by step from their
cover, but not without loss, one man being killed and
another badly wounded, whilst arms and accoutrements
were struck and smashed on all sides, though on the
whole we escaped with comparatively little damage.
One man, in the act of capping his musket, had his
finger shot off by a ball, which broke the lock, and two
others were slightly wounded, one in the leg, the other in
the ribs; many Kaffirs were killed. By nine o'clock the
60th Rifles had gained the Heights and joined our left,
while Colonel Michell's brigade, which had ascended
the Pass, was seen advancing towards the south-west
corner of the plain, through a narrow belt of wood on the
right of the position to which the enemy were now
driven, and on clearing the bush the rear of the column
was attacked, though no opposition had been made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the passage of the main body. The 91st faced to the
right about, and after a sharp skirmish, in which they
suffered one or two casualties, drove the enemy back
with some loss, when the column crossed the front
of the enemy's position, and reinforced our right, which
had for some hours maintained the brunt of the fire on
the most difficult ground; after a continued roar of
rolling musketry and booming guns the last body of the
enemy was driven from their position, and retreated
through the opposite belt of forest and across the ridge
beyond it towards the Kromme.</p>

<p>It was now noon, and having been under arms and
actively engaged since four in the morning, we were
right glad of the short rest which was allowed on
the whole Division uniting at this point; and halting
near a spring, we broke our fast on biscuit and beef.
The 60th Rifles had captured about sixty head of cattle,
having had one man killed and another badly injured.
The poor fellow was brought up with the rest of our
wounded, and amputation being found necessary, his
arm was taken off on the field at once; one of the Marines
was also dangerously wounded, and died two days
after. We buried the two Highlanders on the mountain
top, and piled a cairn above their grave. Fresh ammunition
was issued to all the regiments, from the reserve
on the pack-mules, and after a halt of about two hours,
the force separated in different directions; Lieut.-Col.
Michell's brigade consisting of the 2nd, 6th, 91st, and
artillery bivouacking on the ground, in the centre of the
enemy's late position. Lieut.-Col. Nesbitt's column,
consisting of the 45th regiment, the 60th Rifles, and
Marines, was sent down again to the camp in the Blinkwater
valley, by the eastern spur of the range, covered
by the artillery; the Fingo Levies descending the valley
to waylay the Blinkwater passes, and prevent the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
escaping in that direction with cattle to the Amatolas;
while the 12th, 74th, and cavalry marched with the
General for our old bivouac at Mundells Krantz. On
our route across the table-land we were suddenly fired
on from a belt of bush skirting the edge of the precipice
and running up from the Waterkloof forests below,
but we continued our march without taking further
notice of them than throwing out a flank patrol of
the 74th, and a few Cape Corps; they were merely
a straggling party, more intent on annoying us than
fighting, and did no other harm than wounding a couple
of horses. Our total loss this day was only three men
killed and seven wounded, after having driven the enemy
from an almost impenetrable stronghold&mdash;a dense forest
with close thorny underwood, and endless barriers of
huge masses of detached rock.</p>

<p>The shadows of evening were falling rapidly as we
once more entered the lines of burnt out fires on our
old bivouacking ground, and we were not long in turning
in to rest, lying down round the fires. One or two of us
now began to feel the effects of our late wet work, in the
shape of acute rheumatism and lumbago, which kept us
awake in spite of fatigue.</p>

<p>We marched early in falling sleet, to join the other
brigade, on the ridge facetiously denominated "Mount
Pleasant." Several large Kaffir fires were seen on the
heights on the opposite side of the Waterkloof valley,
the smoke hanging heavily in the damp air. The tops of
the distant mountains and most of the nearer peaks
were white with snow that had fallen during the night,
and the breeze from that direction blew so bitterly cold
on our saturated clothes, that we were perfectly benumbed
in our light marching dress, which, though
warmer than agreeable under the mid-day sun, was a very
indifferent protection against such weather. On reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the bivouac of the brigade in occupation, we found
they had suffered much more than ourselves; the chill
wind swept unbroken over the bleak exposed ridge
which was covered with snow, and the trenches which
the men had dug before the rain came on, to sleep in
under shelter of the earth thrown out of them, were
full of water. A consultation took place between the
two Commanders as to the advisability, or rather practicability
of making any movement in such weather.
During this, partly to keep themselves warm, and partly
to commemorate the death of an unfortunate Kaffir spy
whom they had just assegaied, the Fingoes gathered in a
circle and performed a war dance, with unusually savage
yells and gesticulations. The rain was evidently determined
to make a day of it, and about eleven o'clock
we were driven back again to our old bivouac,&mdash;of the
very sight of which we were thoroughly weary. It had
been visited during our absence by the Kaffirs, the spoor
of whose bare feet was traceable round nearly every fire,
on which we found they had been roasting the offal of our
slaughtered cattle, and actually eating the bones, which
were gnawed off, as if by large dogs. The sloppy ground,
after twenty-four hours' rain, and trampling of men, horses
and cattle, had become a perfect bog, in which we sank at
every step; and with the driving rain, which, like a white
cloud, came sweeping across the bleak plain till it dashed
in our faces, with the fitful gusts of wind that scattered
the ashes of our wretched fires in every direction, our
day's halt was anything but a lounge. One of our men,
wounded in the fight of the day before, died in the
afternoon, and was buried near the graves of Norris and
the other brave fellows interred here. The pitiless rain
changed only for sleet at night, and the men suffered
very much, their blankets having been completely soaked
as well as their clothes for many hours, while the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
was unfit even for the cattle and horses to lie on. In
the morning we found ourselves whitened over with hail
and sleet, the fog so thick that all operations, were out
of the question, and another day in this cheerful spot
was before us. All day long the belt of wood rang with
the sound of the axe; Officers and men, for the sake of
exercise, busily occupied themselves in cutting down
trees, chopping up and carrying wood for the fires;
those that could not borrow an axe or bill-hook, made
fires round the standing trunks and burnt them down,
when the branches were torn off and carried smoking to
the camp, and piled on the fires, which at last burned up,
high and cheerily, in spite of the descending deluge.</p>

<p>As there appeared to be no chance of the weather
improving, the General determined to move the following
morning at all hazards. The troops mustered
without bugle call, and silently took their places, the
blazing fires casting a bright ruddy light on the dripping
ranks, standing motionless in the heavy rain in which
the men had lain all night without a murmur. At five
we moved off, and after an hour's march through very
long grass reached the edge of the heights above the
Waterkloof valley, into which we at once descended,
scrambling down a tremendously steep rocky path leading
abruptly into the deep glen, the advanced sections
of the 12th looking like Lilliputian soldiers far beneath,
as the breaking daylight showed them already landed
at the bottom. Having re-formed our ranks, we proceeded
up the valley to attack the new position taken
up by the enemy on the southern head of the Kromme
range. The big guns and musketry on the heights above
our left told that the other brigade was already engaged,
and soon after, as we got further up the valley, we saw
heavy clouds of smoke rising from the huts they had
fired. On reaching the point where the valley branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
into two, we took the road leading up the one on our
right, and presently came on a village prettily situated,
and indeed almost hidden in the bush; the Kaffirs had
but barely escaped, and one or two lurking in the bush
were caught by the Fingoes; a small body of them
were also seen creeping on hands and knees through the
long grass over the crest of an opposite hill, and a party
of our horse dashed after in pursuit, and cut them off.
We ascended the mountain by a steep winding road;
the rain had at last ceased, and the sun was now overpoweringly
hot, though a few hours before we had
thought it impossible to be too warm. We worked our
way through two belts of wood on the ridge without
finding any recent spoor of the enemy; and after marching
some distance across the grassy table top of the
Kromme came to the little basin, on several previous occasions
the scene of our bivouacs. The 91st regiment
detached from Michell's Brigade, which now held the
belt of forest on the top of the range, between Fullers
Hoek and Waterkloof, came through the forest in our
front and reinforced the column, when we advanced on
the enemy's position, and entering the bush had a sharp
skirmish, killing several Kaffirs and capturing some
horses, after which there being no further opposition, or,
indeed, any one to be seen, we returned in a heavy
shower to the flat, and bivouacked for the night.</p>

<p>Before dawn we entered the belt of forest separating
us from the other brigade, and met with no obstruction;
the bush was still as death, and at the top of the path
leading out of it lay the corpses of the Kaffirs killed
on the 14th. The stench was intolerable. It was impossible
to remove them, and as they lay right along the
centre of the narrow track we had to file singly past
them. A few yards further on lay the clean picked
skeleton of the Serjeant of the 12th, killed at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
time, which was recognised by the fragments of his red
coat, torn to pieces, and trampled in the dirt by the
hyænas and jackals, which invariably attack white flesh
in preference to black. Just at the edge of the wood on
the open, lay many dead Kaffirs, and the putrifying carcases
of four horses shot on the above occasion; we were
nearly all ill from the continued insufferable stench, and
hurried along to escape it.</p>

<p>We now stood on the N.W. corner of the Horseshoe,
and on the site of the principal Kaffir village; the
ground was covered with the remains of burnt and
levelled huts; native utensils and ornaments lay about,
burnt dogs and dead horses, and here and there the
corpse of a Kaffir or Tottie, with hundreds of flattened
bullets and fragments of exploded shells that had torn
up the rocks around. In front of the position was a
line of small stone breastworks, ingeniously constructed
of loose rocks, built up about three or four feet high,
and from three feet, to twenty, in length, invisible at
musket range, on account of their similarity to the rocky
ground on which they stood.</p>

<p>We halted for some time here, and the sun was so
blazing hot that we stretched blankets over the stands
of piled arms, as a shelter from its burning rays;
in front of us, rising in the distance above the dark
forest that sloped abruptly into the valley below,
stood the grand and lofty Winterberg, its lower
ranges of a deep purple tint, the higher white with
snow. Along the front of the forest the huts were
totally destroyed, but just within its shelter we found
many still standing, untouched and quite deserted, also
cattle kraals and stables, made of young trees, felled and
twined in and out between the larger standing ones;
in the huts were all sorts of odd things&mdash;calabashes,
beads, bridles, hatchets, karosses, bags of seeds and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the red clay with which they cover their bodies, rheims,
large pieces of the root of the Noë-boom root, peeled for
food; two or three litters of blind puppies, jealously
guarded by half-famished curs; quantities of sheep-skins
and piles of bullocks' horns, and all kinds of
minor rubbish, with several bullet moulds, and a quantity
of newly-cast balls. The trees around were scored
with bullet marks high and low, and many shivered
into splinters by the shells; one or two large and
recently-made graves were found, and a sickening
odour arose from the thick underwood, where there
must have been many more bodies hidden among the
tangled thickets. While clambering among the huge
masses of creeper-grown rock, which were rudely
thrown together in every size and form, among the
forest trees growing out of their clefts, I accidentally
observed, half covered by the wild vine, a narrow
opening between two enormous crags, and peeping in
with some trouble, found, to my astonishment, a cave
or chamber capable of holding a dozen or fifteen
men, the floor covered with grass matting and sheep-skins, while the entrance was naturally concealed by
a clump of thick bushes. From such hiding places
our troops were shot down by unseen enemies, and
officers picked off at the head of their astonished men.</p>

<p>At noon a mule waggon was sent over to us from the
General's party, across the "Horseshoe," containing a
supply of meal, which, as we had not tasted food since
the previous evening, was at once made into a sort
of water porridge, and greedily devoured; an order
arriving for us to move up to the support of the 2nd
Queen's hotly engaged just in front, we took our half-emptied
mess-tins in our hands, eating the parboiled
mess as we went along. We were extended and lay
down among the loose rocks in support, the firing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
heavy on both sides and stray shots each moment falling
among us or striking the stones and flying off with a
ringing <i>whirr</i>. For more than an hour we impatiently
lay here inactive, though under fire. The 6th took up
a flanking position in a clump of large trees and opened
a steady fire on the enemy; the 2nd were then withdrawn,
and retired through our line, their faces begrimed
with gunpowder, bearing one dead and one wounded
man. As soon as they were clear of the range, the
artillery of the 2nd Brigade opened fire on the Krantz;
the Kaffirs, however, maintained their ground, and
greatly annoyed the 6th by a dropping fire from invisible
marksmen. Shortly after, the howitzers of the other
column were brought round to the south front of the
position, all the guns were going at once, and in a few
minutes completely drove the enemy from their stand
in the rocky cover, scattering and killing the groups
that kept appearing in front. A round shot striking a
rock, ricocheted obliquely, and passed between our
regiment and the 12th, and close to two officers, but
fortunately did no harm, and went bounding and crashing
through the forest, clearing its terrific course with a
humming roar. The enemy completely dislodged by
the infantry from their fastnesses in the bush, and now
driven from their successive rallying points, by the
admirable practice of the guns, under Lieutenant Field,
were seen in the distance retreating over the hills and
down the valleys in every direction towards the Kromme
Forest, the women carrying large bundles on their
heads, a sure sign of their "trekking."</p>

<p>Late in the evening we returned to our bivouac, and
long before daylight were again trudging across the
dark mountains. At dawn we came to the top of
the Wolfsback Pass, and as we halted for a few
minutes to allow those in front to file into its narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
shady path, we discerned, on the opposite hill across the
dark intervening kloof, two or three fires, and a few
Kaffir scouts creeping along its elevated ridge, in
a stooping posture, though plainly visible to us against
the brightening sky. We made our way down through
the steep forest, and reached the ruined farm-house
at the foot of the mountain, where we had halted
for breakfast about six weeks before, and seeing no
signs whatever of the enemy in these forests, in which
it was thought they had taken refuge, again ascended
the range by a path a little more towards the eastern
extremity, and crossing its ridge, descended into the
valley called Fullers Hoek. This is a deep wooded kloof
of the Blinkwater, till lately in the territories of
Hermanus, who found its thick forests and almost
inaccessible retreats so favourable for the concealment
of the horses and fat cattle of the colonists, that he
was at last deprived of it by the Government, and
allotted a more open tract of country in its stead,
belonging to a burgher, named Fuller, who, taking
possession of the Chief's valley, gave it the name it now
bears. The General having moved down into the
Blinkwater, with the artillery and horse, co-operated
with us, as we scoured through the scattered bush,
with companies extended right across the glen,
clearing the cover from one end to the other, as we
advanced, burning and destroying all the cattle kraals
and huts in our way. Some Kaffirs, on the summit of a
lofty perpendicular precipice crowning a steep wooded
mountain on our left, shouted to us to let the kraals
alone, and one of them gave us a song! they were far
beyond rifle range.</p>

<p>At noon we reached the camp near the ruins of
the old Blinkwater Post, and found the 45th regiment,
the 60th Rifles, the Artillery, Marines, and Cape Mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Rifles, already encamped. Commissariat supplies were
sent up to Lieut.-Colonel Michell's Brigade, left in
position on the Heights, at the head of the Waterkloof.
A party of us rode into Fort Beaufort, and
the 60th marched in in the evening, on their route
back to King William's Town. We all dined together
at the very humble inn, and slept at night on the chairs,
tables, and floors, lots being drawn for an antiquated
wooden billiard-table, in consequence of its superior
accommodation.</p>

<p>We were to have returned with commissariat waggons
next day, to the camp, but having mistaken the hour,
I was left behind, and had to follow them alone. The
road enjoyed no very desirable reputation, but as they
could not have got more than three or four miles, I
trusted to my horse's speed for that distance, and
having ridden at a quiet pace for the first mile, set
spurs to him at the entrance of the bush, and dashed
along at a rate that would have made me a very
difficult flying shot. When half way through the
bush, four or five armed Hottentots stood, about two
hundred yards before me, whom I at once concluded
were some of the Levies belonging to the waggon
escort, and congratulated myself on having so soon
overtaken them. My horse's foot striking with a sharp
click against a stone in the deep sandy road, made
them look round, when to my surprise they all bolted
into the bush and disappeared; but for this lucky
panic, I should, the very next moment, have ridden
into the midst of the Rebels, who must, no doubt,
have thought that I was at the head of a party.
Before they had time to discover their mistake I was
round the next turn, and about a mile further on
came up with the train.</p>

<p>"Winkel waggons" had come out to the camp, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the "winklers," or private traders, sold everything they
had, from black sugar and meal to sardines and pickled
salmon, at the most absurd and extravagant prices;
the soldiers lavishly spending their accumulated pay in
coffee, bread, and other comforts, which was rather encouraged
than otherwise, as preventing the drunkenness
that would otherwise ensue the first time they got into
quarters.</p>

<p>In the evening the mail arrived from Beaufort, having
seen several parties of Rebels on the road lurking among
the bush and rocks, and on the hill-sides; the return-bag
was despatched with a double escort, and an order issued
forbidding any one to go into Beaufort without a proper
escort. A Kaffir spy, found prowling in the bushes close
to the camp, was chased, and for some time eluded discovery,
having disappeared in a most sudden and mysterious
manner at the edge of the river; he was, however,
finally detected by the quick eye of one of the Levies, who,
holding up his finger, quietly pointed to a small motionless
black object on the water, near the branch of an
old tree; this was the nose of the Kaffir, but so still and
motionless was the muddy water that when the Fingo
raised his firelock, and took a long steady aim, every one
was ready to roar with laughter at the expected "sell;"
bang went the old flint musket, and to their surprise the
Kaffir leaped up and dropped again with a heavy
splash into the blood-stained water.</p>

<p>The waggons had brought our tents, which we had
now been without for nearly three weeks, and the camp
was pitched with the greatest alacrity, and in half the
usual time. Markers were placed and "covered,"
their bayonets stuck in the ground, streets marked out,
and tents brought from the waggons; in a moment there
was a hammering of pegs on every side, the tents were
stretched out on the ground of each line or company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and at the sound of two notes on the bugle the whole
rose up in their places; what had seemed confusion
became the most exact order, and the bare plain was
suddenly transformed into a canvas city, the whole
being completed in less time than it took the wood and
water parties to bring fuel from the neighbouring bush,
or fill the camp-kettles at the river.</p>

<p>Heavy rain again came on in the evening with every
prospect of a steady continuance, and, though in tents,
we were now quite indifferent to it ourselves, we could
not but pity the poor fellows on the heights, exposed to
the full violence of the storm. We were in for another
"three days rain."</p>

<p>The enemy having entirely abandoned the position,
Colonel Michell's Brigade marched down into the Blinkwater
during the afternoon of the 31st; they had seen
the spoor of Kaffirs and cattle trekking out of the district,
and had taken some Kaffir women prisoners, who
stated that there were only a very few of their people
still lurking in the bush, looking after the wounded
whom they were unable to remove, and had secreted in
their undiscoverable and inaccessible retreats in the
twenty square miles of forest that clothe this rugged
range of mountains. Some rebel Hottentot women had
also been captured, who represented themselves as
wandering lambs of the scattered flock of a Mr. Reid,
of the Kat River London Missionary settlement. They
were very dirty&mdash;disgustingly so&mdash;and were barely
covered by their filthy rags; they were set at liberty,
and advised to leave that part of the country as soon as
possible. Several horses had been taken by this brigade,
and amongst them we recognised that of our lamented
Band-master, taken on the 8th of September, whose
coat was also found in one of the huts.</p>

<p>The gallant brigade, literally in rags, marched steadily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
through our camp for Fort Beaufort in the storm of wind
and rain, many with bare feet, and their thin and scanty
clothes, so tattered as to be hardly decent. They had
suffered very much in their exposed position, diarrh&oelig;a
and dysentery having laid up whole sections.</p>

<p>For the next three days the rain never ceased for one
minute, and the ground became so thoroughly saturated
that the floors of our tents were as wet as the flooded
plain outside. The wet trembling horses, with drawn-up
bellies, and the damp soldiers, with turned-up trews,
splashing about amongst the long rows of soaked canvas,
looked nearly as wretched as the shivering blanket-covered
Fingoes that crouched round the smoky fires.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
FOURTH ATTACK ON THE WATERKLOOF.&mdash;DEATH OF LIEUT.-COL. FORDYCE,
AND OTHER OFFICERS.</h2>


<p>On the morning of the 4th of November the camp
was left standing, guarded by the invalids and least
efficient men of each regiment, and we marched, under
command of Lieut.-Col. Fordyce, up the Blinkwater
Pass, and bivouacked at Eastlands, the enemy being
reported to be re-assembling on their former ground. The
whole of the grassy plain was glowing with bright gladiolus,
blue lobelia, everlasting flower, and the graceful sparaxis,
of which we found a variety, peculiar to this mountain,
of a deep indescribable colour, almost approaching to
black.</p>

<p>The next day the 74th Highlanders moved to the head
of the pass to cover the ascent of commissariat waggons.
We lay under the shade of a spreading mimosa, a merry
party, little dreaming this would be the last time we should
all be together; some sketching, some sweeping the vast
panorama with their glasses, and others practising long
ranges with their rifles at the aloes on the opposite side
of the kloof. The united contributions of our haversacs,
spread on the grass, made a plentiful, but heterogeneous
meal, of which, however, very shortly not a vestige remained,
our voracity, with constant living in the open
air, having become quite chronic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>During the day the other columns of attack were
collecting from all quarters, and marching on their
assigned rendezvous, in readiness for the grand simultaneous
movement to be made the following morning at
dawn.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Michell's Brigade proceeded to the Blinkwater
camp, to be ready to work along the foot of the
Kromme and Fuller's Hoek. Lieut.-Col. Sutton, with
two squadrons of the Cape Corps, and the Horse Brigade
of guns, moved round the base of the Kromme Range,
and past Haddon, to a point at the foot of Bush Neck,
where he was to be joined by all the Fingo Levies, and
detachments from Lowie and the Mancazana district.
We remained in our camp of the night before. The
evening passed in anticipation of the coming struggle,
which it was generally thought would be decisive, if
not severe. Our Colonel, who had just ridden in from
Post Retief, joined us, and we remarked that he appeared
more than usually interested that evening, and walked
from fire to fire, conversing with each group of officers
in a quiet tone of the movements of the other brigades
during the day, the supposed strength of the enemy,
and the prospects of the weather, which had become
threatening since sunset. After our customary pipe,
we wished each other an early good night, as we were to
march to the attack before daylight, and withdrew to
our patrol-tents.</p>

<p>At half-past four o'clock (November 6th), the word
was given to move off in quarter-distance column of
sub-divisions; not a bugle sounded, and with feelings of
unusual excitement the brigade quitted its ground, and
marched across the open flats towards the head of the
Waterkloof Pass. The mountain was enveloped in
clouds so dense that we could not see more than twenty
yards before us, until about six, when a gentle breeze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
cleared the summit of the ridge, and left the clouds
floating like a vast sea below our feet, completely shutting
out the lower world, the tops of one or two of the
higher hills, appearing through the motionless expanse,
looked exactly like islands, some wooded, others bare
and rocky, with jutting peninsulas stretching out, as it
were, into the smooth water.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock Lieut.-Col. Sutton's force was reported
to be moving up along the Waterkloof valley
towards its head, and to cover its advance Colonel
Fordyce immediately placed his brigade in position on
the ridge, and extending four companies of our regiment,
supported by two of the 12th, advanced towards the
belt of bush intersecting the enemy's position, which we
entered without much opposition, and occupied for the
next six hours.</p>

<p>The village at the head of the Pass having been rebuilt,
in a great measure, since our last attack, an order
was given for volunteers to advance and set fire to it,
and, with a party of four men, I had the pleasure a
second time of burning the whole of the huts to the
ground, with all they contained, together with a large
quantity of bullocks horns and hides, stored up for
future trading. I had a narrow escape of being shot by the
Rebels, who kept up an irregular fire upon us from the
wood the whole time; a ball whirring close past my ear as
I was kneeling down blowing away at a bunch of lighted
dry grass which I had stuck into the wall of a hut, and
sending the reeds and mud plaster flying into my face.
The village being destroyed, skirmishers were again
thrown forward into the forest, and we were ordered to
work our way through it to turn the left flank of the
enemy's position on a ridge of rocks, unapproachable
from the front. An occasional bang, bang, from the
thickets, followed by the crashing of balls through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
cover, as we advanced, kept us all on the <i>qui vive</i>.
Nothing more difficult and trying can be imagined than
our laborious progress through this all but impracticable
forest, studded throughout with enormous masses of
detached rock, overgrown with wild vines, twining
asparagus trees, endless monkey ropes and other creepers,
so strong, and so thickly interlaced as almost to put a
stop to our advance; covered with dense thorny underwood,
concealing dangerous clefts and crevices, and
strewed with fallen trees in every stage of decay,
while the hooked thorns of the "wait a bit" clinging
to our arms and legs, snatching the caps off our heads,
and tearing clothes and flesh, impeded us at every step.</p>

<p>The advantages which the Kaffir possesses on such
ground over regular troops is immense; armed only with
his gun, or assegais, free and unencumbered by pack,
clothing, or accoutrements, his naked body covered with
grease, he climbs the rocks, and works through the
familiar bush with the stealth and agility of the tiger,
while the infantry soldier, in European clothing, loaded
with three days rations, sixty rounds of ball cartridge,
water canteen, bayonet, and heavy musket, labours after
him with a pluck and perseverance which none but
British soldiers possess, and which, somehow or other,
in spite of every obstacle in every clime, ever wins its
way in the end. Sir Harry Smith, in his despatch of the
18th of December, 1851, to Earl Grey, gives a very just
estimate of the character of the formidable enemy with
whom we had thus to contend, whom he describes, as
fully as much so as the Algerines or Circassians,
and says, "Fraternized with the numerous and well-trained
Hottentot race, they are, in their mode of
guerilla warfare, most formidable enemies, as much so
as I ever encountered; and I speak with some experience
in war, to which I may lay claim." The situation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
officer on such occasions is one of no small danger and
responsibility; himself leading through all impediments,
a coveted mark to every lurking Tottie or Kaffir, he
has not only to exercise the greatest vigilance to prevent
his men being separated and cut off, but must carefully
mark his proper route and bearings, lest he wander into
the endless mazes of the trackless forest, and not only
lose his whole party, but involve co-operating bodies in
disaster.</p>

<p>DEATH OF LT. COLONEL FORDYCE<br />
(<i>Waterkloof Nov. 6<sup>th</sup> 1851</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>After leading our flank into the bush in person, and
giving his final orders, Colonel Fordyce proceeded to
the left of the regiment to direct their movements
against the fastness held by the enemy, from the shelter
of which they kept up an annoying fire. At this moment
he had advanced to the edge of the bush in front,
and was in the very act of directing the attack upon it,
when he was shot through the body, and fell to rise no
more; the last and only words of our brave chief were,
"Take care of my regiment:" he was borne to the rear,
and breathed his last in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Though our heavy loss was not immediately known,
the regiment was for a moment thrown into confusion
in consequence of his last orders having been but partly
delivered. The rebels yelled in exultation, but the
next instant were silenced by an avenging volley, which
drove them in again behind the shelter of their protecting
trees and rocks, which the regiment boldly and steadily
advanced to storm under a fatal fire, which told fearfully
among our ranks. Carey fell, pierced through the
body, at the head of his company, and was carried off
the field a corpse; and immediately afterwards Gordon
was mortally wounded by a ball which passed through
both thighs, and lodging in the body of a soldier close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
by, killed him on the spot. The loss in the ranks was
equally severe; one man was cut down after another,
until, maddened by the fall of their officers and comrades,
the regiment, under Captain Duff (on whom as senior
officer the command had now devolved), rushed to the
fatal barricade with such infuriated and irresistible determination,
as to clear all before them, killing numbers
of the enemy, chiefly rebel Hottentots, who fled in confusion,
and carrying the position, which we maintained
almost unmolested until the troops were withdrawn in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>Beside our deeply lamented officers, the casualties
among our brave fellows were very heavy; Sergeants
Cairnie and Diarmid, and two rank and file were killed;
a Lance-corporal and one private mortally wounded; and
a Corporal and five men severely, two of whom afterwards
underwent amputation.</p>

<p>In the meantime Lieut.-Col. Sutton's Brigade had ascended
the heights by Mundells Krantz, on our extreme
right; and Lieut.-Col. Yarborough, with the 91st regiment,
occupied the left of the position; while the 12th,
lying down in extended order across the open, watched
the belt of bush in the right centre, occasionally exchanging
a shot or two at intervals with a few fellows
perched in the trees. The guns, however, were got into
position opposite this, the enemy's only remaining point
of occupation, and dropped shot and shell among them
wherever they appeared, with such precision that they
must have suffered severely, and were finally obliged to
abandon their last stronghold.</p>

<p>During this, we were holding the position gained at
such cost; and while we lay half hidden among the
forest-clothed rocks, along the edge of the ridge, observed
the branches of the trees above our heads cut in two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and their trunks scored in all directions by the fire of the
late encounter. Among the crevices of the rocks, which
here were in cubical blocks of all sizes, from that of a large
four storied house downwards, we found several of the
enemy's caches, containing axes, bullet-moulds, lead, and
cast bullets, and the usual assortment of ornaments and
articles such as we generally found in every village.</p>

<p>After about two hours, the enemy,&mdash;who had again
crept up to within range, at an angle of the forest which
even the Fingoes had found impassable,&mdash;fired one or
two shots at random into our cover, to see if we were
still there, the balls dropping right among us. Presently
a couple of black heads were slowly raised over the
edge of a rock, but seeing us, were withdrawn so instantaneously
that we had not time to fire. Some of our men
lying flat on the large slabs of stone, and peering down
into the deep forest on the sloping mountain side, made
signs to me, pointing below, and quietly reaching their
position, I had an opportunity rarely afforded of watching
a party of Kaffirs cautiously advancing along the
bottom of the thicket immediately below us, creeping
stealthily through the underwood, perfectly naked, and
armed with assegais and guns. Stopping every few feet
to listen, they peered into the bush before them, their
well greased bodies shining in the occasional gleams of
sunshine that streamed down through the thick foliage
of the trees, and again moved on, avoiding every rotten
twig, and preserving a noiselessness perfectly marvellous.
It was most exciting, as we lay crouched among the huge
grey rocks, from which our bush dress was hardly distinguishable,
to watch them pursuing their deadly mode
of warfare in their own fastnesses. Our men waiting
the moment to fire, had gradually brought the muzzles
of their arms to bear; and without moving their heads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and hardly drawing breath, silently indicated to each
other the whereabouts of fresh comers.</p>

<p>With rifles pointed through the creepers at the edge of
the rock on which we lay stretched, we waited with
fingers on the trigger for a fair shot, and I fancied I could
hear my heart beating. At a signal, bang went twenty
muskets, echoing from crag to crag in the silent wood,
and the treacherous savages met the death they had
been plotting for us.</p>

<p>We still remained here for some hours, the General
requiring the position to be held during his other movements;
the men took out their pipes and smoked to
allay their hunger, which they had no chance of satisfying
until the night's bivouac, while an occasional bullet
lodged in the trees around us, fired by some skulking
Tottie or Kaffir. One or two of us were so fatigued
that notwithstanding the roar of the big guns, we fell
asleep.</p>

<p>At three in the afternoon the clouds again settled
on the ridge, and the fog became so heavy that all
further operations were at an end, and the enemy
having evacuated all his positions, and being nowhere
visible, we were withdrawn from our tiresome duty
of occupation. The whole of the troops were called
in, and assembled in column on the open; a mule
waggon came down for the wounded, and we bivouacked
for the night on the bare bleak ridge
close by.</p>

<p>The troops moved mournfully about their duties,
every soldier appearing to feel the heavy loss we had
sustained; the cries and groans of the wounded, which
could be heard in every part of the little camp,
added to the general feeling of sadness; and, like a
pall hanging over the gallant dead that lay in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
solitary tent, in front of which there slowly paced a
sentinel, the cold dark clouds rested on the lonely
peak, and enveloped us in a mist so dense that our
evening fires were hardly visible at a few yards, and
our moving figures loomed through it like giants. We
went to take a farewell look at the bodies of our late
gallant Chief, and poor Carey, as brave a young fellow
as ever lived, highly talented, and beloved by us all.
They lay side by side with the men who had fallen
that day, the corpses ranged on the grass, each covered
by a blanket; reverently uncovering their heads, we
gazed silently on their familiar faces; the Colonel's
was as tranquil as though he were sleeping, which,
but for the blood that covered his uniform and hands,
might have been supposed. A change had passed over
poor Carey's. The men lay with fixed and rigid
features, some with their stony eyes still open, or their
lower jaws fallen; it was a mournful and touching
spectacle. I could scarcely realize the death of two
officers, whom I had daily met for years, and had only
a few hours before conversed with in the full vigour of
life. Slowly and silently we left the tent, and without
speaking sought our own fires.</p>

<p>The wounded, who lay on their stretchers on the
ground, received every possible attention; their own
comrades, on such occasions, rough as they may appear,
move gently about the sick man, anticipating such wants,
and administering such comforts as are in their power,
with a woman's delicacy and forethought. Poor Gordon,
over whose head we had built a shelter of green boughs,
suffered dreadful agonies all night. The doctors, when
questioned as to his case, shook their heads in doubt;
the ball had entered the outside of the right thigh, and,
passing through it, entered the inside of the left one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
fracturing the bone close to the socket, and leaving
two frightful lacerated wounds. So close was the
Kaffir who fired it, that Gordon had attempted to seize
his gun.</p>

<p>Soon after dark a drizzling rain came on, and the
wind swept piercingly cold over our lofty resting place;
the men threw up little walls of the loose stones and
rock that lay about, or dug holes in the softer parts,
and piling the earth round them and large slabs of stone
over, crept in for shelter, and all but the orderly officers
and weary sentinels were soon slumbering after the
fatigues of the day, in happy forgetfulness of its horrors.</p>

<p>A white frost covered the ground when we were
roused at dawn by the bugle's réveillé; the clouds still
hung round us, and rolled along in the deep valley
beneath, while officers and men crowded indiscriminately
round the few still burning fires in vain endeavours
to warm their half frozen feet and fingers. The
bodies of the dead were placed in a mule waggon for
burial at Post Retief, fifteen miles across the table-land,
for which place it set off, accompanied by a party of
officers, who had obtained permission from the General
to join in this last sad office. I followed slowly after
them with a strong escort guarding the wounded, accompanied
by our surgeon, Frazer. Poor Gordon, from the
nature of his wounds, was unable to bear the motion of
a waggon, and was carried on a stretcher the whole
distance, by the men of his company.</p>

<p>As we proceeded across the wide grassy plain, its
cheerfulness after the dusky bush, and the brilliant
flowers, as they waved joyously in the bright morning
sun, seemed in strange contrast with our sad cortège.
The whole ridge literally glowed with gladiolus, amaranth,
aphelexis, and a host of other beautiful flowers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the slopes of the little Winterberg Mountain rising
verdant from the plain, about half a mile off, were
covered with patches of the scarlet gladiolus, which
were so brilliant and thickly studded, that, as even
the men observed, they looked like pieces of red
cloth spread out on the grass. All along the way we
gathered mushrooms in such quantities that we were
soon laden with as many as we could conveniently
carry. In one or two places belts of bush, running up
from the wooded kloofs below, encroached on the green
plain, and as Kaffir spies were hovering round, we
kept out of musket range of the treacherous cover.</p>

<p>Heavy firing from the artillery in our rear now
announced that our Division was again engaged, and
we fervently hoped with happier results than the day
before. After a few miles farther we looked down on
our right into the celebrated Kat River Valley, well
known, as the birthplace of the Hottentot rebellion,
and one of the finest and most fruitful districts in
the whole colony. Surrounded by vast chains of fine
mountains, this extensive valley spread its smiling
uplands and fertile holms, picturesquely relieved by
belts of valuable timber, and watered by the winding
Kat River; the villages and farms now levelled with
the ground, and silent and deserted except by prowling
Kaffirs and wild beasts. The whole hill-side was here
covered with the Protea grandiflora, a bush about eight
or ten feet high, very much resembling the rhododendron
in leaf and general appearance, and bearing a large
pink and white cup-shaped flower, something like an
artichoke.</p>

<p>Gordon's sufferings were very great, though borne
with a fortitude only equalled by his courage in the
field; his thirst was insatiable. When about half way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
one of the stretcher poles broke in two; we had, however,
taken the precaution to bring a spare stretcher,
which was laid on the ground, the other placed gently
on it, its poles withdrawn, and we went on again as
before.</p>

<p>We were still four miles from the end of our march,
when it became evident that we were going to have a
mountain storm; the lowering sky deepened into an
intense indigo behind the distant mountains; eddying
clouds of sand, dry grass, and leaves, caught by successive
whirlwinds, came sweeping along our desolate track,
until a bright blinding flash shot from behind the dark
peak of the Didama, and the oppressive silence was
suddenly broken by a terrific peal of thunder, followed,
before its prolonged echoes had ceased among
the crags, by a downpour of hail and rain, such as
we never before witnessed. The hailstones were literally
the size of walnuts, and fell with such force that
the horses became frantic, and in a couple of minutes
we ourselves were soaked to the skin. As we entered
a narrow glen, down which foamed a genuine Highland
stream, the road became much rougher, and was most
trying to the wounded men, who yelled with agony as the
waggon jolted over the rocks; seeing me removing the
large loose stones out of the way of the wheels, a private,
named M'Coll, with his left arm in a bandage, after
amputation of the fingers, jumped out and walked the
rest of the way, assisting me with his one hand.</p>

<p>At a turn in the narrow road, the little fort appeared
about half a mile before us, standing dreary and lone on
a rising ground in the centre of an amphitheatre of dark
mountains half hidden in the clouds. As we approached
it a detachment of the 12th came out to meet us, and
helped to carry the sufferers into the hospital, already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
half full of wounded men. I was in time to take a last
look at the bodies of our chief and poor Carey, which
were laid out in the commissariat forage store, before the
Sergeant-Major nailed down the hastily made coffins.
The funeral will never be forgotten by those who were
present. The thunder, mingled with the booming of the
distant artillery, rolled grandly and solemnly among the
mountains, as the motley groups from each regiment
assembled in their worn and ragged uniforms. As the
rough deal coffins were borne out, the "firing party,"
dripping wet, and covered with mud, "presented arms,"
the officers uncovered, and we marched in slow time out
of the gate and down the road, the Pipers playing the
mournful and touching "Highland Lament," to where
the graves had been dug, a few hundred yards from the
post, and close to three others newly made, the last resting
place of our gallant men who had fallen on the 16th
of October.</p>

<p>The funeral service was read by Captain Duff, the
men with swarthy faces, and tattered dress, standing
round, resting on their "arms reversed," while the thunder
rolled unceasingly, and the inky black clouds threatened
another downpour.</p>

<p>Captain Carey, C.M.R., stood by the grave side of his
brave young kinsman, and as the bodies were lowered
into the graves and solemnly committed to the earth,
every one was visibly affected; the customary military
honours were paid; three times the roar of a hundred
muskets reverberated among the hills; the last faint echo
died away in the distance; the hoarse word of command
broke up the motionless group; one after another we
stepped to the grave sides to take a farewell look; and
marched back in silence to the Fort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>During our absence, a miserable barrack room with
roughly paved floor, and smoke blackened rafters, had
been hastily cleared for poor Gordon, into which we carefully
bore him, and adding every obtainable blanket or
plaid to the thin straw mattress, and doing all in our very
limited power to cheer him and alleviate his sufferings,
left him for the night with his trusty and attached
servant Stuart.</p>

<p>On entering the crowded hospital, the groans of the
wounded men were heart-rending, and their sufferings
most acute, the heat of the climate and the loathsome
flies and vermin (which no care can keep away from the
smallest wound), adding to their misery. A Sergeant of
the 12th and one of the 74th had each undergone amputation
of the leg, and hardly appeared to understand
our words of encouragement. We learned from one or
two, who spoke feelingly of his kindness, that our late
gallant chief had personally visited, and inquired into
the wants of the sick, the very evening before he was
killed (when it will be remembered he rode over from
our camp), and the commissariat officer of the post showed
us an order the Colonel had written on the spot, for every
possible comfort for the wounded&mdash;wine, porter, sago, tea,
milk, &amp;c., to be provided at his own expense and responsibility.
These were the last words he ever wrote.</p>

<p>We found Ricketts of the 91st, who was mentioned
as dangerously wounded on the 14th of October, in the
Waterkloof, lying alone in a small room in a very precarious
state; he had no belief whatever in his danger,
and talked gaily of what he should do when he got out
again&mdash;though constantly interrupted by coughing and
spitting blood, which bubbled out of the wound in his
chest at every breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The hospitable detachment gave us, notwithstanding
the great scarcity of provisions, a more substantial meal
than we had seen for a long time, to which we sat down
twenty-one in number, at a long deal table, in a bare
whitewashed room; but as our kind entertainers had been
unexpectedly sent up to the empty fort from the field in
"patrol order," it was a much more difficult affair to
provide a dinner service than a dinner. At night we
lay in our blankets on the floor, side by side, and as we
listened to the mountain storm raging without, congratulated
ourselves on sleeping under a roof, a luxury we
had only once before enjoyed since leaving Cork.</p>

<p>We visited Gordon again in the morning before starting
for the camp, and assisted the surgeon to dress his
wounds and arrange his bed; and sat as long as we
possibly could wiping his brow and moistening his lips.
On leaving, he begged us to come over as often as we
could to see him during his probable long confinement
in this lonely place, which we promised to do, but never
saw him again. After three days of excruciating agony,
the broken limb suddenly mortified, and he was carried
off in a few hours; so died this young soldier, alone in a
wild mountain fort, thousands of miles away from home
and relatives, with only a servant to witness his last
moments.</p>

<p>Poor Ricketts, whose exquisite songs had so often enlivened
our long evenings, died the same day, having
been gradually sinking for some time previously. His
death, which occurred some hours the first, was purposely
kept from Gordon, but the sound of the funeral volleys
reached his ear, and in a quiet voice he blamed his servant
for not telling him of it; in two hours after, a like
salute was fired over his own grave. His loss was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
sincerely mourned both by officers and men, his honest
sterling qualities, kindly heart, and dauntless bravery in
the field having endeared him to all.</p>

<p>Having commissariat cattle to escort to the camp for
the troops, I gave them in charge of the Fingoes, following
in rear with the escort. When little more than
half-way back to where we had left our camp, we saw
the whole Division about two miles off, with its long
retinue of waggons, trekking across the open plain,
and while wondering what it could mean, a mounted
express rode up, with an order from the General for us
to continue on the road as far as the top of the Blinkwater
Pass, where we halted till the division came up;
eager to hear the results of their operations on the
previous day.</p>

<p>They had cleared the whole of the Waterkloof Range,
the 12th, 74th, 91st, and Levies, having succeeded in
driving the enemy from the forest, with the exception of
a few small scattered parties (doubtless in attendance on
the wounded), who played at hide and seek with the
wearied troops, and baffled all attempts to dislodge them.
They had, however, suffered very severely; twenty
bodies were found, and a much greater number must
have fallen in the thick bush from the admirable practice
of the howitzers. On our side, Captain Davenish,
of the Levies, was mortally wounded, and seven men of
different regiments more or less severely.</p>

<p>The road down the hill was almost impassable after the
heavy rain; tremendous gullies, in many places four feet
deep, constantly threatened to overturn the waggons, and
it was several hours before we reached our old camp in
the Blinkwater valley. It had been held in the interim
by detachments of the 2nd and 6th regiments, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
now marched out on one side for Fort Beaufort, as we
entered at another. We were rejoiced to find ourselves
once more under canvas. In the evening the
following Division Order, on the death of our late Colonel,
was published in camp:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
"<i>Camp Blinkwater, November 9, 1851.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"It is with the deepest regret that Major-General
Somerset announces to the Division the death of Lieut.-Col.
Fordyce, commanding the 74th Highlanders.</p>

<p>"Lieut.-Col. Fordyce fell, mortally wounded, in action
with the enemy, on the morning of the 6th, and died on
the field.</p>

<p>"From the period of the 74th Highlanders having
joined the 1st Division, their high state of discipline and
efficiency at once showed to the Major-General the
value of Lieut.-Col. Fordyce as a commanding officer;
the subsequent period, during which the Major-General
had been in daily intercourse with Lieut.-Col. Fordyce,
so constantly engaged against the enemy in the field,
had tended to increase, in the highest degree, the
opinion which the Major-General had formed of Lieut.-Col.
Fordyce as a commander of the highest order, and
as one of her Majesty's ablest officers, whom he now so
deeply laments (while he truly sympathizes with the
74th Highlanders in their irreparable loss) as an esteemed
brother soldier. *  *  *  *</p>

<div class="right">

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>This was followed a few days afterwards by the subjoined
General Order:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">"<span class="smcap">General Order</span>, No. 197.<br />
"<i>November 13, 1851.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"The Commander-in-chief has this day received the
report from Major-General Somerset that the gallant
and enterprising Lieut.-Col. Fordyce, 74th Highlanders,
has fallen in action with the enemy on the 6th instant.
His loss to her Majesty's service is a severe one, and his
Excellency conceives he cannot express his regret in
terms more applicable, than in the Division Order of
Major-General Somerset, which is herewith published.</p>

<p>"Gallantly thus falling in the service of his Queen
and country will perpetuate the memory of Lieut.-Col.
Fordyce.</p>

<p>"The service has also to regret the loss of Lieutenant
Carey, 74th Highlanders, a rising and promising officer.</p>

(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<span class="smcap">A. J. Cloete</span>, Lieutenant-Colonel,<br />
"Deputy Quartermaster-General."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The day following was Sunday, and a small party of
us having got leave set off on horseback to attend divine
service at Fort Beaufort, this being the first time that
any of us had had an opportunity of going to a church
since landing in the country. Our dress excited no
other emotion than respect among the well-dressed
congregation, though our weather-stained and soiled
uniform, patched with leather and every kind of cloth,
and our worn-out boots burnt to a reddish brown, looked
strangely out of place. As we once more heard the
service read and chanted, a host of thoughts came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
crowding on my mind of home, and bygone days and
scenes, with a feeling of thankfulness at having been
preserved through so many dangers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
CATTLE LIFTING&mdash;KAFFIR AND FINGO CUSTOMS, ETC.</h2>


<p>Nov. 18th.&mdash;Between ten and eleven in the forenoon,
parade and drill having been got over as usual in the
early morning, the camp, in shirt sleeves, was hushed in
its first siesta; we were all lying, like so many cucumbers
under frames, in our sultry tents, which, in spite of
wet blankets and "raised walls," were but a degree more
bearable than the scorching summer sun outside, when
distant shots were suddenly heard, and an alarm was
given of an attack on the cattle out grazing at the foot
of the hills, about a mile from the sentries. In an
instant all were astir, a party of Cape Corps were in
the saddle, and followed by a yelling posse of naked
Fingoes on bare-backed horses, thundered past us as
we stood outside the lines, telescope in hand.</p>

<p>A body of Kaffirs, who must have descended from the
mountains before daylight, had concealed themselves in
a deep sluit, or empty watercourse, running through the
best pasturage, and waiting until the cattle had got
between them and the hills, rushed out, and, after an
ineffectual resistance from the outlying picquet of Levies,
two of whom were wounded, had gone off at full gallop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
with the whole, which we now saw them driving in three
separate herds up the grassy sides of the mountain; the
ascent, however, was fortunately so steep that our horsemen
had reached its foot before the Kaffirs were half
way up; a very pretty skirmish took place through the
bushes, and the slope was soon thickly dotted with puffs
of blue smoke. The cattle were recaptured and brought
in, with the exception of some dozen which had escaped
into the bush. The trembling herdsmen got a reprimand,
and a warning to keep nearer home in future.
Many of the Hottentot women in camp seemed by no
means pleased at the issue of the chase, and in fact,
whenever they dared express it, their sympathies were
evidently on the side of the enemy.</p>

<p>The merry Fingoes who had borne the most conspicuous
part in this little affair, as a matter of course,
made it an excuse for a jollification, and after sunset
their camp, some few hundred yards from ours, resounded
with loud shrieks and laughter, and their quaint
and striking choruses, with the thumping obligato accompaniment,
rose above every other sound in the
evening air. It was a constant amusement to us to
visit these happy good-natured fellows when in standing
camp, and see their mode of life, which is exactly like
that of the Kaffir in times of peace; their extraordinary
habits and customs are most interesting. On this occasion,
finding a blanketed group sitting apart in a circle
smoking the <i>dagha</i> before described, I squatted down at
their invitation, cross-legged, in the ring, and receiving
the rude cow-horn pipe in my turn, took a pull at its
capacious mouth, coughing violently at the suffocating
fumes, as indeed they all did more or less, and after
tasting the nasty decoction of bark which followed round
in a calabash, took the politely-proffered spitting-tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of my next neighbour, signally failing, however, in the
orthodox whistle, to the unbounded delight of the
Fingoes, whose hearty ringing laughter was most contagious.</p>

<p>In this way they sat and passed the time until their
grand banquet was ready, which we saw preparing on
the fire in the shape of a large three-legged iron pot full
of tripe and offal, from which issued a reeking steam of
most unsavoury odour. Others with long festoons of
unwashed intestines in their hands roasted them bit by
bit on the glowing embers, and holding the frizzling end
between their teeth cut it off with their sharp assegais
so closely as to make one quake for the safety of their
protuberant lips; after helping himself, the envied
owner would do a few inches more for his neighbour,
sticking it into his open mouth for him burning hot,
and sever it in like manner.</p>

<p>The fondness of the Fingo for animal food is extraordinary,
and when in the field he will do almost anything
to obtain it; the daily ration is a mere trifle to
him, serving only to whet his appetite, and in spite of
the consequent severe self-punishment of being two days
without, he cannot resist devouring the whole issue of
"three days' rations" at one glorious meal. Marrow bones,
however, are his especial weakness, and it is quite a
picture to watch him roasting them in the hot wood
ashes, affectionately turning them over, his happy face
all beaming with oil and smiles, and then breaking the
unctuous luxuries between two smooth stones, which, as
well as the bones, are licked perfectly clean, and after a
minute and repeated inspection reluctantly thrown away
with a sigh of regret.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this propensity for flesh, the Fingo,
like the Kaffir, seldom touches it in time of peace, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
keeps his cattle to look at and admire, living entirely
on pumpkins, maize, Kaffir-corn, roots, and milk. The
greater part of the latter is obtained from goats, of
which they frequently possess very large flocks; it is
never used except sour, a small quantity being always
retained in the milking vessels to turn the new milk.
It is most excellent; and in spite of the black, dirty
looking grass baskets in which they keep it, we never
could resist the cool refreshing draught. They believe
that if the milk of a cow or goat is drunk in its natural
state, the animal will at once cease to give any more.</p>

<p>As to religion, the notions of a people whose language
does not contain a single word to express a Deity, may
naturally be supposed to be very vague. The general
belief with regard to the Creation, at least of those who
think about it at all, is, that from a large cave (<i>Uhlanga</i>)<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
in the far East, where the very finest specimens of every
production of the world grow of their own accord, all
that moves on the face of the earth originally proceeded.
Cattle first, and then man; the different animals, birds,
fishes, &amp;c., being subsequently turned loose for their joint
use and amusement. Through some unaccountable mistake,
however, one fine day, the cattle not being sufficiently
wide-awake, allowed themselves to be circumvented
and taken prisoners by the men, and have ever since
been kept in subjection, ranking merely as second in
the scale of beings.</p>

<p>Since the arrival of the white man in the country,
these people have learned something of the existence
of an invisible God under the title of Utixo<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> (an
obsolete Hottentot word, meaning "my arm" or "safeguard"),
though, as it is invariably used like the Italian
"Felicita," or "Viva," after sneezing, it is very doubtful
what idea they connect with it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>Superstition enters largely into their customs; they
not only believe in spirits, and resort to the mummery
and incantations of "witch doctors" to avert their evil
influence, and wear charms to protect them from sickness,
misfortunes, or violent deaths, but lest they should
injure the prospects of their husbands or male relations,
the women are prohibited from ever mentioning their
names or cognomens, which are always verbs or nouns,
with fanciful prefixes or terminations, one woman making
use of a word which another of a different family dare
not utter, and for which she has always to substitute
one widely differing from that in use among the men.
For instance, a woman whose husband's name is a compound
or derivation of <i>Umoya</i> (air), instead of the forbidden
word uses <i>Umklengetwa</i>; in like manner for
<i>Inkwenkwe</i> (a boy), <i>Ixagi</i>; for <i>Ipupa</i> (a dream)
<i>Itongo</i>, and so on.</p>

<p>This singular custom (called "uku'hlonipa") greatly
increases the difficulty of learning this very complicated
language, for as all Kaffir proper names are thus
formed, and every man has from three to eight wives,
or more, each with their own extensive circle of male
kinsmen, and a woman must not use a word which
contains the sound even of any of their names, its
construction becomes doubly involved. The peculiar
clicks, also, are another impediment to be overcome
by the learner. The letters <i>c</i>, <i>q</i>, and <i>x</i>, represent
three different sounds (such as a driver uses to
encourage his horses), denominated respectively "dental,"
"palatal," and "lateral" clicks, which, when repeated in
a double or treble click in the same word, as "ukunycabagcazela,"
to tremble; "uquqoqo," the windpipe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
"Ukuququkaquka," changeableness, all uttered
by the Kaffir with the greatest clearness and fluency,
add to the striking sound of his beautiful language,
every syllable of which ends with a vowel, and is spoken
with a most musical intonation, dwelling generally on
the penultimate vowel in a very remarkable manner.
In its construction it is entirely a language of ever-varying
prefixes, by which verbs, nouns, and pronouns,
are conjugated, declined, and combined. Each of the
twelve declensions of nouns has its own set of prefixes,
which, also, by a singular and harmonious rule, govern
the sound of the prefixes of the verb, or other words in
the sentence connected with it, and which are thus
assimilated into what is termed the euphonic concord,
the third person of the pronoun, for instance, having 144
different prefixes to be used in combination with different
words. On the proper use of these, no easy matter,
the correct speaking of the language entirely depends,
and in the study of it the European experiences the
greatest conceivable trouble with the least satisfactory
results to be found in the acquisition of any language
under the sun, as any one who attempts it will soon
confess. The similarity between the Kaffir and Fingo
languages is so exact, they may be called one, there
being no greater difference than there is between Highland
and Lowland Scotch, if indeed as much.</p>

<p>The Fingoes are, in reality, only one of the three
sections of the original Kaffir race, having been driven
from their position on the north-eastern boundary of
Kaffirland by the other tribes, who made incessant war
upon them, in which many thousands were killed;
the rest, having unluckily taken refuge in the territory
of Hintza, a Kaffir chief, were enslaved by him, and
kept in the most barbarous servitude. Sir Benjamin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
D'Urban, however, set them free in 1835, and assigned
them a territory within the country lying between the
Kei, Klip-Plat and Keiskamma Rivers, and they have,
in consequence, ever since remained our faithful and
active allies.</p>

<p>The Kaffirs are, undoubtedly, one of the finest races
of savages in existence, and of a physical type very
different from, and superior to all other South African
races. Their customs and institutions also are, in many
cases, so peculiar and remarkable, exhibiting strong
traces of similarity to the wandering tribes of Arabia,
that they have naturally led to the supposition of a
distinct origin, and there is certainly much to confirm
the belief that they are descendants of Ishmaelite
tribes, who have wandered down the east coast by the
Red Sea. In their divisions and sub-divisions into
tribes and families, their system is patriarchal; their
wealth, like that of the Arabs and other nomadic
tribes of the east, consists almost entirely of flocks and
herds, and in their abhorrence of pork they are as
cordial as the most devout Mussulman or Jew. Polygamy
is common, and what is most remarkable, circumcision
is regularly performed by the Kaffirs, and about
the age of fourteen, which has a singular correspondence
with the recorded fact that Ishmael himself was in his
fourteenth year when circumcised with Abraham. It is
however, with them, a mere custom, and not a religious
rite. They say they do it because their fathers did it
before them. After the operation has been performed,
the youths cover their bodies with white clay, and live
apart for some days in huts built at a distance from
the village. Many other traits, of Eastern origin, might
be adduced, such as kissing the feet; shaving the head;
either as a sign of grief, or while under a vow; the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of skins as bottles, for milk, &amp;c. and of goads; in driving
cattle, which, however <i>follow</i> the chief herdsman, who
leads them from one pasture to another, calling them
generally by name; the piling up stones before going
out on an expedition; and offering burnt sacrifices on
the commencement of a war, which, with many others,
are the more conclusive as combined evidence in confirmation
of the theory, as they are confined to the Kaffir
race alone in South Africa. Polygamy is only restricted
by the bovine riches of the men. A chief, or a wealthy
individual, has generally seven or eight wives at least
(all living amicably together), whom he has purchased
from his various fathers-in-law, for certain numbers of
oxen, in proportion to the rank and attractions of the
ladies. This is left to the heads of the tribe to settle,
and to ensure a fair valuation, the bride in prospect,
"in native beauty clad," is made to walk round a ring
of influential old gentlemen appraisers, seated on the
ground, before each of whom she stops a few minutes;
when, having been criticised by the circle, she retires,
and a consultation is held to fix the number of cattle
her charms are worth, the decision being final and
without appeal either for father or suitor. The Kaffir
women are universally well made, their symmetry being
displayed to the greatest advantage by the most lofty
and easy carriage; their teeth are brilliantly white, and
moreover they preserve a degree of modesty far above
the depraved Hottentots, though the latter boast the
superior refinement of clothing.</p>

<p>It may be interesting, by the way, to state how their
children are trained to that duplicity and cunning so
much prized among them. As soon almost as they can
run they are initiated into petty acts of theft; papas
and mammas descanting together on the cleverness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
proficiency of their respective children, will each back
their own to steal something from the other's hut before
sundown; the most successful competitor being warmly
applauded. That they should succeed at all, when the
owner of the hut to be plundered is, of course, on the
look out, seems marvellous, but I was assured by a
respectable Boer, that he had seen the children accomplish
feats of this kind, bringing off articles of bulk and
value, notwithstanding the whole family on whom the
depredation was to be committed were on their guard.
Lying also is another native accomplishment held in
high esteem, and as diligently cultivated; with what
success the celebrity of some of their first chiefs and
counsellors in this form of diplomacy, bears ample
witness.</p>

<p>The only covering worn by the Kaffir is the well-known
kaross, which supplies the place of our own plaid;
it consists of different skins; that of the tiger, is a distinctive
mark of chieftainship, and not allowed to be
worn by any other class; among the lower ranks a coarse
blanket is now generally substituted. The married
women sometimes wear a very small forked apron
of leather, adorned with beads, over their breasts, and
the wives of royalty have the privilege of a peculiar
head-dress of fur, one of which, in my possession, taken
from the Royal Gaika Kraal, on the Amatolas, is like
a large loose fez, with the fur outside, turned up and
ornamented with small beads, and on each side long
broad "ribbons" of fur tipped with tiger skin. In
necklaces, armlets, &amp;c., they show great taste and ingenuity,
and some of them are very interesting; here
again the tiger's teeth are appropriated to aristocratic
use; one, which was cut from the neck of a dying chief,
and presented to me at the time, consists of alternate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
bunches of teeth and large white beads, on a cluster of
strings of small black ones. Another is composed
entirely of the lower joints of human finger bones strung
through the knuckles, to the number of twenty-seven.</p>

<p>Both races, as is also usual with the Arabs, tattoo
their chests and arms in a kind of serrated pattern; and
the women, in addition, use a kind of red clay mixed
with fat to smear their bodies and paint their faces, also
daubing and moulding their crisp hair with it into clay
ringlets, which have a very singular appearance. Sometimes
they sprinkle their hair, after smearing it with fat,
with glittering particles of mica, great quantities of
which are left after heavy rains in the ruts and gullies
of the roads. The men stick through their ears a straw,
a porcupine's quill, or ostrich feather; and both Kaffirs
and Fingoes use a strap or belt round their naked waist,
called "lambele," which they tighten when hungry and
unable to procure food.</p>

<p>Although, as stated above, their flocks and herds constitute
their chief wealth, and cattle hold the highest
place in their estimation, being supposed to have been
created superior to man at first, and none but the grown
up males are allowed the honour of milking them, or
even entering the kraal, &amp;c.; yet, in time of peace they
never touch flesh, unless it be game, living almost entirely
on milk, fruit, and vegetables, with berries, leaves,
and roots, of various kinds; the principal of these are
the Indian corn or mealies, <i>Amazimba</i> or Kaffir corn (a
species of <i>Sorghum</i>), and the root of the Noë Boom
tree,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> very like a coarse stringy turnip.</p>

<p>Game they often kill with the knob-keerie, a short
club, two or three feet long, generally made out of an
olive stock, with a part of the heavy root attached, or
shaped out of rhinoceros' horn, which they throw with
wonderful force and accuracy, and can knock down a
man as well as kill a hare or buck, at twenty or thirty
yards, with the greatest certainty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>Their other and most formidable weapon is the
assegai, of which each one in war-time carries a bundle
of seven, loosely tied together by a thong or rheim of
hide attached to a long "charm stick." One of these
is large and heavy, for stabbing, with a broad blade or
iron head a foot or eighteen inches long, and a shaft
much shorter and stouter than the rest, which are used
for throwing. They hurl them with incredible force;
and, as I have myself seen, can send them clean through
a man's body. We often used to put up a cap or other
small article on a bush when in camp, for our friends the
Fingoes, to try their skill at: they made excellent practice
at thirty or forty yards, and could cast them with
sufficient force to annoy a body of men at nearly double
that distance, though their aim at a single individual
would be, of course, uncertain.</p>

<p>With these effective weapons, serving both as bayonet
and javelin in the hands of an athletic, sagacious, and
undaunted race, who are trained from infancy to their
use; combined with the musket, which they quickly
learned to handle with considerable precision; and the
adoption of just as much of military tactics and system
(acquired from the Cape Corps and Kaffir Police deserters),
as improved without hampering their skirmishing
mode of bush-fighting; added to a marvellous
concert and unity in their movements, the Kaffirs were
a most formidable foe even to the flower of the British
troops, who had to encounter and storm them in their
own natural fortresses, rendered almost inaccessible by
the dense bush of impenetrable thorns, &amp;c.; too succulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to be burnt, yet affording to the crawling native, the
opportunity of lurking in unexpected ambuscade at
every point.</p>

<p>Such fearful odds against so comparative a handful of
troops, not to mention the excessive hardships, privations,
and vicissitudes of climate, render it less a matter
of surprise that complete success was for a time delayed,
than that it was ever ultimately achieved.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
NIGHT ATTACK ON CAMP.&mdash;POST RETIEF.</h2>


<p>On the night of the 20th, the Kaffirs who, since their
unsuccessful raid, had been constantly hovering about
in small parties on the hill sides, watching our cattle
and our movements, treated us at midnight with a
volley into the middle of our encampment, which woke
us suddenly from our first sleep; the bugles sounded
the "assembly," and we had to tumble out of bed. As
I groped about in the dark for my clothes, I felt a
peculiar sensation of unprotectedness, in my night-shirt, as
the balls whistled past the tent, not having been under
fire before in that costume; something of the same sort
of feeling prompted B&mdash;&mdash;r, on a later occasion, in crossing
the enemy's line of fire, to pull his jacket collar up on
the exposed side of his face as a protection. After several
frantic attempts to unhook my tent door, tightly contracted
by the dew, I had to crawl out below, and found
the men drawn up on their own lines as if they had
been there all night. A few shots were fired from the
river bank, which however did no harm, and were silenced
by the sentries without our aid; the skulking thieves,
frightened at the hornet's nest they had disturbed, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
themselves off at once. In five minutes after we were
dismissed, the camp was still as death, and in the morning
I felt uncertain, on first waking, whether the whole
had not been a dream.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Governor-General was at this time
preparing a force to move across the Kei into Kreli's
country, to punish that chief for robbing the traders,
treacherously harbouring the fugitive Kaffirs and their
cattle, and while professing the most friendly feelings
and intentions towards us, aiding and abetting a war
with which he was in no way identified.</p>

<p>That the Colony might be properly defended during
the absence of so large a portion of the army as must
necessarily be required for such an expedition, the following
dispositions of the troops were ordered to be at once
carried into effect for the formation of the frontier line
of defence,&mdash;the 74th Highlanders and 91st regiment,
with the Local Mounted and Fingo Levies, to be posted
in Fort Beaufort and the district, under Lieut.-Col.
Yarborough; the 12th regiment with detachments of
Irregulars, as a line of patrol from Fort Brown to the
mouth of the Great Fish River, under Lieut.-Col. Perceval;
and a detachment at Fort Peddie, under Major
Wilmot, R.A. This arrangement of course broke up our
standing camp, and in the general movement of the
troops, I found myself under orders for Post Retief, in the
Winterberg Mountains, to accompany Bruce, appointed
to that command; the detachment of the 12th, then
garrisoning it, rejoining their regiment in the Albany
district. As it was probable we might be imprisoned in
that solitary place for six months at least, cut off during
the absence of the expedition from all communication
with the world, and as we had nothing with us in camp
beyond the clothes on our backs and the contents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
our saddle bags, it was necessary to make some preparation
for our change of quarters, and having to march
for our destination at daylight next morning, I set off
at once with a mounted servant for Beaufort to get
such supplies and necessaries as were absolutely required,
taking advantage of the escort just starting with the
mail.</p>

<p>After hastily performing my errand and with some
difficulty getting a waggon and oxen to return with
me, I found to my annoyance that owing to the indolence
or probably intended treachery of the driver,
who kept me waiting two hours for his oxen, I was
too late to join a party going out to the camp with
waggons, and there being no escort to be obtained
from Fort Beaufort, I had no alternative, as our early
march from the Blinkwater next morning rendered my
return that evening imperative, but to start a little
before dusk accompanied only by the servant. We
had got about half way or a little more, and had
entered the most bushy and dangerous part of the road
when it fell nearly dark, the sheet lightning becoming
most brilliant. I rode along by the side of the oxen
in the narrow track, and was in the act of lighting
my second cheroot, when a volley was suddenly poured
into us from the bush along the edge of the river on
our right, so close as to blind me for an instant with
the flash; one of the oxen, which were on my left,
dropt down dead, and two more rolled over wounded,
while the waggon was struck in half a dozen different
places; the rest of the terrified cattle faced round
kicking and plunging, got their legs over the trektow,
and wound themselves into an inextricable mess. The
driver and leader, one a Totty, the other a Ghonah,
either purposely or from fear refused to assist in extricating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
them, and when I threatened them with my
pistol, bolted into the bush on the other side of the
road and disappeared. Left to our own devices, we
made an ineffectual attempt to cut out the dead and
wounded oxen from the trektow with a blunt tobacco
knife, the Kaffirs firing at us from the bush all the time,
but found it utterly impossible; they now completely
surrounded us, forming across the road in front and
rear, and firing in quick succession, one shot striking
the cantle of my saddle, and another wounding my
horse in the head, which made him almost unmanageable;
it was madness to stand to be shot at by so many
guns, so we determined to make a dash for the camp,
and with a shout rode right at the fellows in front,
who as I fired my second pistol jumped aside and let
us pass, though a parting shower of bullets, as we
galloped off, made the dust fly from the road under
our horses' feet. In less than five minutes after reaching
the camp, a party of Fingoes had turned out, and
quickly getting a span of oxen together, we returned
to the rescue of the unfortunate waggon at a sharp
trot, most of the Fingoes keeping up with the horses
the whole two miles. Though the oxen were gone, our
speedy return prevented the rascals destroying or ransacking
the waggon, from which they had only taken a
box of cheroots and a case of brandy; the former,
as we afterwards discovered by their spoor, they
had chopped up into tobacco, and on the latter they
had got so drunk that they lost two of the bullocks,
which, as Bruce and I had to pay for the missing ones
out of our own pockets, we were only too glad to
recover. The dead ox was quickly skinned and cut up
by the Fingoes, who, finding to their surprise I did not
want it for my own use, regarded the affair from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
moment as a great lark, and sat up all night eating
beef. To ourselves the result was not so satisfactory,
having subsequently to pay £70 for the oxen.</p>

<p>After accomplishing the ascent of the Blinkwater
Pass, which we had hoped not to have seen again for
some time, we, late the next day, came in sight of the
little fort, which in the setting sun, with its background
of green and purple mountains, distinctly defined against
the clear sky, looked now as bright and cheerful as it had
loomed dark and gloomy on our former melancholy
visit.</p>

<p>Our approach caused an evident commotion in the
little garrison, to whom our coming, and their consequent
"relief," were entirely unknown.</p>

<p>About 800 yards from the post, a quantity of old trampled
wheat-straw was pointed out to us, scattered along the
roadside, where it had been left by the enemy, since the
6th of February, on which day they had thrashed out a
whole stack in sight of the fort, at that time occupied by
the Burghers and Dutch, with their families and herds.
A party of about 700 or 800 Kaffirs and Hottentots,
who had first attacked the post, took possession of the
little water-mill out of musket shot from the walls, and
their women, to the number of about 150, coolly commenced
thrashing out the corn, which they took away
with them in a waggon, while the men from the cover of
the rocks and some old quarries, kept up a constant fire
on the fort, the interior of which from its absurd position,
was entirely commanded and raked from a hill within
half musket range, so that no one dare move across the
yard, or show himself within the walls. The besieged
inmates were almost entirely without food or water,
having hurriedly taken refuge from their adjacent farms
on the first alarm. Three days afterwards, relief arrived;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Commander Bowker, with 250 men, fell upon the enemy
in rear, and drove them off after a fight of three hours.
The walls and gates showed innumerable bullet marks,
thickest round the windows and loop-holes, and in
many the balls still sticking in the woodwork.</p>

<p>Post Retief was formerly a farm house (parts of which
are still remaining, and built into the present walls of the
fort) belonging to Piet Retief, a distinguished Field
Cornet of the Winterberg district, who, while in treaty
with Dingan, king of the Zulus, for a grant of territory,
near Natal, for the settlement of the Dutch Border
colonists, of whom he was Governor and Commander-in-chief,
was barbarously murdered with his companions,
by that prince, in the beginning of 1838, and while
actually partaking of his treacherous hospitality.</p>

<p>We found the interior space, or barrack-square,
almost impassable after rain, having been used for many
months as a cattle kraal, the dung lying two or three
feet thick. The removal of this was at once commenced
upon, and men and waggons were busily employed each
day until the steps up to the quarters, were again brought
to light, and the oxen were no longer able to look in
upon us at mess. The vrouws with their dirty children,
pigs, poultry and lumber, were bundled out of the Fort;
the rooms whitewashed and converted into soldiers'
quarters once more; the private dung-heaps at each
door made into one large conglomerate outside the walls,
and the place put into thorough order in less time than
it would have taken one of the lazy Dutchmen to comprehend
the possibility of such a reform.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, General Somerset arrived with
about 500 men, at Whittlesea, the most remote of the
frontier posts, and the following day, having been joined
by Captain Tylden's force, marched through Tambookie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Land to the Umvani, where, on the 3rd of December,
he was joined by Colonel Mackinnon's party from King
William's Town, making his force amount to about 3000
men, with three guns. Lieut.-Col. Eyre with about
1000 men moved, two days later, on the missionary settlement
of Butterworth, so that the enemy's attention
being first attracted to the General's Division, the
move on that station might be effected without danger
to the inhabitants from Kreli's people, and the two
forces then moved along the course of the Kei co-operating
with each other.</p>

<p>On Sunday we had divine service performed by the
Rev. J. Wilson, a clergyman of the Church of England,
who having been a resident in the beleaguered fort, had,
like Patrick Walker at the siege of Derry, taken his
share of duty with the little garrison, mounting guard,
and standing sentry with his musket like the rest. The
best of the men's barrack rooms served for a church, and
a large hand-bell having been rung outside to summon
the few settlers living within musket-shot of the walls,
the gates were locked. The walls of our humble church
were hung round with battered arms, patched accoutrements,
and water canteens, haversacks, and all the equipments
of the field; the congregation of soldiers and
settlers was large and most attentive; the "prayers for
the ending of the war," and for the "sick and wounded
within these walls," forcibly reminding us of our position,
so different from that of the congregations at that
hour assembled in the peaceful villages at home.</p>

<p>The change from the field to quarters was so great
that we could not get over the novelty of sitting down,
to chairs and tables at our meals, or sleeping on a bedstead
and between sheets, and at first felt much astonishment
each morning on awaking to find ourselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
bed in a barrack-room, though the said barrack-room
was nothing more than four whitewashed walls, a floor of
unhewn stones, a roof of naked rafters well browned
with wood smoke, decorated, just over my bed, with
a couple of swallows' nests, the birds having taken a
dirty advantage of the broken window. The sense of
suffocation at night, after so many months sleeping in
the open air, was such that we found it impossible to sleep
without every door and window wide open.</p>

<p>Our circle consisted of Bruce and myself; Dr. Warden
the assistant-surgeon; the worthy Chaplain, and a commissariat
officer, Mr. Hedley; totally isolated from the
world, except at long intervals, we were now locked up in
the little mountain fort 5000 feet above the level of the
sea, and, with the exception of a few Dutch Laagers,
thirty miles from any human habitation but those of
hostile Kaffirs. Our little force was not more than seventy
rank and file.</p>

<p>We had not been here more than two or three days,
when the Kaffirs swept off a Boer's cattle grazing about
three miles off; we saw them through the glass ascending
the steep side of the lofty Didama, but as they were
already more than half way up, and the distance to the
foot of the ascent was at least four miles, we had to
content ourselves with watching them; for by the time
we could have got about half way, they would have
been safely hidden in the extensive Zuurberg forest, on
the other side of the ridge. There were about forty
Kaffirs urging the cattle up the mountain side, and we
could distinguish the forms of others covering their
ascent, and crowning the crags on the summit. In the
evening, soon after dark, as we sat smoking and chatting
round the open hearth, on which blazed a cheerful
wood fire, often very acceptable in the evenings of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
lofty region, distant shots were heard, and the sentry on
the walls reported firing at the nearest Laager, about a
mile off, and at the same time two Burghers, living
close outside the gates, having been admitted, brought
word that the enemy were attacking the Laager, and
they would all be cut off without immediate assistance.
Bruce, accordingly, sent me off at once with a party of
twenty-five men: the night was so dark, that when
outside the gates we hardly knew which way to move,
until the flashes of muskets in the direction of the
Laager showed us to what point to steer. On approaching
the place, the moon, which had been hidden by a
mass of dark clouds, suddenly shone out clear as day,
and at the same moment we were fired upon from the
rocks on our left, just above the huts of the Fingo
herds, a few balls whistling past us, though after our
shots in reply no one dead or alive was to be seen.
Having with some difficulty satisfied the suspicious
Dutchman on sentry, we passed along the side of the
house, which was pierced with narrow loop-holes, the
windows being all bricked up, and leaving the men outside
for a few moments, I was admitted through some
out-works of timber and mud walls, likewise crenelled
for musketry, and found myself in a large, low, dirty
room, with sacks of meal and corn, furniture, barrels,
and all sorts of supplies piled on every side, and a crowd
of Dutch men, women, and children, the former in round
jackets and broad-brimmed hats, with cow-horn powder
flasks at their sides, and immense roers in their hands,
all jabbering at once; while the latter squatted round
the fire half dressed, or peeped out of the different beds
allotted to each family.</p>

<p>It appeared that the Kaffirs had endeavoured to carry
off the sheep and cattle from the kraal, but the unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
resistance, and our equally unlooked for reinforcement,
had obliged them to abandon the attempt.</p>

<p>After the proferred "bidgte sopie," or wee dram of
"Cape Smoke," which it would have been bad manners,
if not bad taste, to have refused, we crossed the stream
at the garden foot, and made our way to a second
Laager, a mile further, where firing had also been heard;
one of the Boers accompanying us as guide, and hailing
the sentries in Dutch and Kaffir on our approach. Here
they were more strongly fortified, a flanking block house
and "covered way" rendering the defences complete.
As at the last farm, we found all the people sitting up in
a state of fear and excitement, the Boers and roers as before.
Several Kaffirs had shortly before been seen hovering
about; the dogs giving tongue in a manner not to be
mistaken; but after making a circuit of the whole place,
we found no one, and having shown ourselves sufficiently
in case any of the enemy should be lurking about, we
returned to the house. The people were delighted to
have the troops with them in such an isolated position,
and were very anxious that a part at any rate should remain
all night; the "sopie" had again to be taken and
no heeltaps; waiting till the setting moon dipped behind
the hills, and all was once more in darkness, we
silently moved off by a bridle path, and without a sound
or a word regained the fort, so that any spies lurking
about the Laagers could not possibly tell we were not still
there.</p>

<p>For some days we made patrols in different directions
round the country, constantly meeting with a magnificent
pair of secretary birds, which appeared to move in
a circle of about a mile radius from the post, and became
like familiar friends. We visited the remaining two of
the inhabited houses, the inmates of which we found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a state of barricade and constant alarm, guns loaded and
capped standing in the corners of the rooms, and the
labourers working close to the house with their roers by
their sides; and one day made an excursion with a
waggon to a ruined school-house, in a lonely position at
the foot of a lofty mountain, from which we took the
liberty of borrowing the forms and tables for our unfurnished
lodgings in the Fort. Nothing could be more
desolate and melancholy than the deserted building;
the doors creaked in the wind, swallows and grey
spreuwe had built their nests in every corner of the
schoolroom, forlorn spelling books and catechisms lay
strewed about the ground, imprinted with the footsteps
of wolves and jackals, and the broken windows were
darkened by a rank growth of jungle and weeds.</p>

<p>One day soon after this, as we were returning from
covering the descent of a mounted patrol into the Kat
River valley, getting occasional shots as we wound along
a Kaffir path, round a higher ridge of the Didama, at
Oribee and Rheebok, two Kaffirs were detected peeping
over the tops of some detached rocks, which lay on the
smooth green slope of the mountain side; we galloped
in a few seconds across the short intervening space,
but quick as we were they had disappeared in the
most mysterious manner, and nothing was to be seen
of them beyond a few foot-prints, which could not be
traced, and three horses, of which we made prizes.
While wondering whether they had sunk into the
earth or vanished in air, several distant shots fired in
quick succession, attracted our attention to a hill about
a mile off, behind the fort, and on bringing our glasses
to bear on the distant puffs of white smoke, we were
astonished to perceive a large body of Kaffirs, mounted
and on foot, engaged with our outlying picquet, and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Burghers. Away we went full "tripple" down the
mountain side, at the risk of rolling head over heels to
the bottom, dashed across the small stream at a flying
leap, and spurred up the steep banks to the post, where
we found the "alarm" signal flag flying, the gates locked,
and the troops under arms. While Bruce brought on
the infantry at the double, Hedley and I galloped up
the hill and joined the Burghers, who, vastly outnumbered,
were getting the worst of it, and retiring slowly
before the enemy, who could not have been less than
300 at the very lowest computation, a third of them
mounted. About 200 of their force pressed on the
right of our little line of some two and twenty, while
the remainder hovered round the left, and our only
wonder at the moment was that they did not close
upon us and annihilate the whole, which they might
soon have done; but the Kaffir has a particular dislike
to open plains and hand to hand fighting; this,
and the bold determined bearing of the burghers, alone
preserved us. Still it was impossible to hold our ground
against such odds; we were being gradually driven
back by their heavy fire, and our right flank was on
the point of being turned by a fresh body of the enemy,
who suddenly made their appearance from the krantz
below, and rushed yelling onwards, till the party of infantry
appeared over the rise, when they were seized
with a panic, and took to flight, the whole of the force
following their example, while we on horseback pursued
them at full gallop, firing into them at close
quarters, and driving them over the edge of the krantz
down into the Koonap valley, killing and wounding
many. As they scampered down the steep rocks at our
feet, crossed the little basin, and clambered up the
opposite rise, dodging among the mimosas, to get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
parting shot, we brought down many of them, counting
above a dozen as they were carried off, dead or
severely wounded, thrown across the backs of their
horses or their comrades' shoulders. The chief, Macomo,
who was distinctly visible on his white horse, high up on
the mountain side, with a sort of staff round him,
shouted constantly to his people, sending mounted
Kaffirs to communicate his orders to those fighting; but
when he saw his men flying he moved higher up, his
white charger grew smaller and his voice more indistinct,
until he was lost to sight. Our only casualties were a
<i>dog</i> killed, and a horse wounded.</p>

<p>It afterwards turned out that while we were thus engaged,
a smaller party of Kaffirs had taken advantage
of the opportunity and driven off a span of trek oxen,
grazing at some little distance down the valley. By the
time we had returned and discovered the fact it was too
late to think of following them.</p>

<p>We found occupation and amusement for some time
in surveying and making maps of the country; improving
our defences, removing detached rocks, filling up the
small quarries, of which the enemy had taken such advantage
during the siege, and building a flanking bastion,
enfilading the two unprotected faces of the fort.</p>

<p>For some weeks we had constant thunder and lightning
every evening, at times most terrific, at others distant,
when the sheet lightning was magnificent, continuing
till eclipsed by daybreak; and we sat every night on the
<i>stoep</i> or raised verandah, in front of our quarters,
watching the dazzling coruscations, which flashed and
flickered each moment over the whole face of the dark
sky, showing for an instant the lofty rugged grey peak
of the Didama, the sentries on the wall, and every
loop-hole&mdash;leaving all in utter darkness next. On one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
such night a brighter flash discovered to one of the sentries
the creeping black forms of two or three Kaffirs,
making for the cattle kraal, a few yards only from the
walls. Without firing, as at the best he could only have
hit one, the sentinel quietly left the <i>banquette</i>, and reported
it to the Sergeant of the guard. We were on the
stoep, enjoying the deliciously cool midnight air after a
blazing midsummer day, and instantly snatching our
rifles from the pegs in the passage, joined the guard, and
having quickly got about a score of fellows out of bed,
posted two or three at each loop-hole, with their muskets,
which had a most absurd effect as the lightning showed
them standing round the walls in their shirts, with bare
legs, in solemn silence. These arrangements having been
made in less time than it takes to describe them, by a
bright flash we fired a volley at three Kaffirs whom we
saw at the kraal, when half a dozen more jumped up
from different spots, and by the flickering blue light we
saw them move across, and a volley blazed the whole
length of the wall, doubtless to their great astonishment,
as all had been still as death till that instant. From
the quantity of blood spoor found next morning, many
must have been severely wounded, if not killed.</p>

<p>Immediately below the fort was a glorious orchard,
full of peach, nectarine, apricot, fig, plum, and pomegranate
trees, the branches literally weighed down with
the glowing load of ripe fruit, which almost as thickly
strewed the grass beneath. In our constant patrols, at
every Dutch Laager and ruined farm that we came upon
for miles round, we found the same; and as the Boers
at the former were most pressing, and the owners of the
latter had abandoned them, we everywhere got as much
fruit as we could conveniently eat, and the men were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
many of them, expiating their over indulgence by
diarrh&oelig;a. The ripe fields of corn, sown in hopes of a
peaceful harvest, waved uncut in many of the more
distant valleys, but nearer to the post, the English
Burghers and Dutch Boers mutually assisted in the
harvest, working with their ammunition pouches on, and
guns and arms within reach. To aid these half-ruined
farmers, Bruce allowed about twenty of the soldiers to
assist in reaping until all was secured, and our men
worked most willingly all day in the heat of the sun,
afterwards volunteering to help a poor old fellow who,
unable to give his labour in return, was not helped by
his neighbours; reaping and getting in his corn for him, as
well as the produce of his little garden. Poor old Hayes
had seen better and brighter times, had come out to the
country with considerable means, and commenced farming
with great energy on a large scale, but he had met with a
series of reverses, and the total destruction of his property
by the Kaffirs, at the commencement of the present
war, which completed his ruin, had affected his mind.
He lived at the foot of the walls in a small Kaffir hut;
but in spite of his rags and poverty, he carefully treasured
up a memento of bygone prosperous days,&mdash;in a
small box he still preserved his old scarlet hunting-coat.
Too proud to the last to accept charity, the only way in
which we could relieve him was by purchasing our vegetables
from him at a liberal price. Shortly after this,
his hut one night caught fire and was burned to the
ground before any water could be got; he looked on
in utter helplessness, as if overwhelmed by this crowning
disaster. When the roaring blaze was over, and nothing
remained but a heap of smouldering ashes, he was gone,
and we all supposed had been taken by some of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
neighbours to their dwellings for the night. In the
morning he was found in his little garden, lying on his
face, cold and dead.</p>

<p>To a Peace Congress, or an Aborigines Protection
Society, such a history would suggest itself as a special
retributive Providence on the unjust aggressor; for to
such philanthropists the real object of sympathy would
of course be the gentle Kaffir and the oppressed Hottentot.
Still, it is unhappily but one out of many a
colonist's history, not the less sad because unknown.</p>

<p>Many of the Burghers, who from the scarcity of forage
could not any longer feed their extra horses, brought
them to us, offering the use of them for their keep; and
Bruce happily conceived the idea of mounting as many
of his men as he could thus procure horses for, and in a
very short time had at his disposal a party of most
serviceable mounted men, an invaluable assistance in our
position in this open country.</p>

<p>The scenery from and around the post was of a
character totally different from anything we had before
seen in the country. In place of the endless
bush and wooded kloofs and hills were smooth grassy
plains, and mountains verdant to their broken summits.
The Didama, in front of the fort, rose abruptly to a
vast height, crowned by a sharp-pointed peak of most
rugged and fantastic form; on the left stretched the
flat-topped range of the Winterberg, on which, from our
verandah, ostriches and hartebeest were occasionally seen
with the glass; and bounding its western extremity
rose the lofty and remarkable "Great Winterberg"
(seen from all points, and equally visible at Botha's Hill,
near Graham's Town), white with snow, which glistened
in changing hues of rose in the setting sun.</p>

<p>In the valley at the foot of the nearer range were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
some romantic kloofs in which were the ruins of several
farm houses, which must have been fine situations in
time of peace, warm and sheltered, luxuriant in vegetation,
with orangeries, vineyards, and orchards of
peaches, figs, and nectarines, shut in by green, sloping
mountains, on which their cattle found excellent grazing,
and well supplied with water from the rocky burns which
bubbled down from the hills to the river in the lower
valley. Now these lately prosperous and peaceful homes
were burnt and blackened ruins, the four walls alone
standing, the orchards overgrown, and rusted implements
of husbandry strewed about, or left as they had
been used on the day of flight or attack. One, in particular,
at Hartebeest Fontein, deserves mention, belonging
to a veteran tar, named Smith, who had served
under Nelson, and been for many years a prisoner in
France, where he had married a French girl, whose
history was as eventful as his own, and who still lived
with him at Post Retief, and shared his misfortunes at
threescore and ten. The house bore ample marks of a
desperate conflict and resistance, the walls being literally
riddled with balls, some three or four hundred at
the very least. The attack had lasted nearly thirty
hours, the little band of fifteen or sixteen defenders,
under the direction of the gallant old tar, then upwards
of seventy, never leaving their posts at the loop-holes the
whole time; only one of their number was killed, and
so gallant and determined was their resistance, that the
enemy at last abandoned the capture or destruction of
the house as impracticable, and retired, carrying off,
however, nearly 1000 sheep, and all the cattle, horses,
and corn.</p>

<p>At the only other farm house near us, beside those mentioned
in our night expedition, on a former page, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
windows were bricked up, leaving only a few narrow loop-holes;
we found the proprietor a perfect specimen of a
Dutch Boer, with the universal round jacket and broad-brimmed
hat, sitting on the stoep in front of his solitary
house smoking the usual green-stone pipe in solemn
silence. Saluting us with a "Goen dag, Baas," as we
rode up, he requested us to walk in; so dismounting, we
entered a large comfortless room, with a stone floor,
dimly lighted by the narrow loop-holes, and half filled with
sacks of meal, and heaps of Indian corn. His vrouw, of
course, was sitting, as usual, in a large chair, doing nothing;
but he hospitably produced the Cape Smoke, which was
made from figs, and as we drank our sopie, we patiently
listened to a long account of his losses and grievances,
having already acquired sufficient Dutch to converse
fluently and understand all he said. After duly reciting all
his troubles, which by the way had not affected his bodily
frame much, he led us into the vineyard, where we found
abundance of the most deliciously flavoured grapes,
one sort, called the "honey-pot," especially so, and of
immense size. The vineyards are of considerable extent,
and the vines kept in standard bushes about the size of
a large gooseberry tree.</p>

<p>The manufacture of Cape wines, Pontac, and Cape
Smoke, is very considerable; the latter is a kind of
whiskey, of a peculiar, and to many, disagreeable flavour.
The best is obtained from grapes, though it is also made
from figs and peaches. At all the farms were large vineyards;
those in the vicinity of the post carefully tended,
but a few miles distant, at the deserted houses, grew in
wild untrimmed luxuriance, the ripe grapes dropping to
the ground unheeded.</p>

<p>The vintage is an odd and picturesque scene; strings
of Fingo women and girls, bear baskets of white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
purple grapes on their heads to the vats, where the men
tread them out, singing monotonous ditties, while the
big drops of perspiration fall plentifully from their
shining faces, and mingle with the rich juice oozing
from between their black toes.</p>

<p>One of our daily patrolling parties returned on the
19th with a boy and a couple Hottentot women prisoners.
They had been robbing a neighbouring farm,
and were caught returning to the Waterkloof with
their skin-sacks filled with half-ripe fruit and vegetables.
We got out of them on cross-examination,
that on the day of their last attack, when we pursued
them with twenty horsemen only, that they had
five Kaffirs killed on the field, and nine others, Kaffirs
and Totties, wounded, several of whom had since died.
We also learned that the enemy were meditating an
attack upon us that night or the night following. In
consequence of this warning, the truth of which there
was no reason to doubt, we brought the cattle within
walls at sunset, doubled the sentries after tattoo, and
kept a sharp look out. About midnight the silence was
gradually broken by the cries of night-hawks and hyænas,
and the barking of jackals answering each other far and
near round the walls, which, however, were in reality
the signals of savages apprising their confederates of our
unexpected state of preparation. After a time, the
sounds, so admirably imitated, grew less frequent, till
they died away altogether. The morning showed us the
soft ground marked on three sides of the fort with the
prints of bare feet and veldt schoenen.</p>

<p>Every evening we continued to be visited by most
appalling storms of thunder and lightning, but generally
without rain. The continued peals rolled and
echoed in a most imposing manner among the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
mountains. A Hottentot boy was killed one afternoon
by the lightning.</p>

<p>Christmas Day had now come round, but instead of
snow outside, and a roaring fire within, it was a roasting,
broiling midsummer day, too hot to stir till after sunset,
when we sat on the stoep unbonnetted and in shirt
sleeves, smoking far into the night, listening to the
shrill chirp of the cicada and piping of the bullfrog, and
talking of home and distant friends. We had neither
wine nor grog to drink to their health and happiness,
but pledged them cordially in coffee.</p>

<p>The Boers reporting a body of rebels to be living in
one of the deserted farms of the Koonap valley, we set
out with a party of mounted men to look them up; but,
as far as the object of our ride was concerned, we had
our trouble for nothing. We went round the foot of the
hills by an extremely difficult path, along the face of a
steep declivity overhanging the rocky bed of the river;
up steep shingly ascents, and down steps or ledges of
rock four or five feet deep, our horses jumping nimbly
down after us, as none but Cape horses could. The farm
was tenantless, and still as death, though there was
plenty of spoor quite fresh; a small fire was still smouldering
in one of the roofless chambers, and the ground
under the fruit trees, which were perfectly stripped, was
thickly trampled. The rebels had decamped, and were
probably looking down on us from the mountain crags
above.</p>

<p>We killed here an immense cobra capello, which rose
erect a full yard above the long grass; spreading out his
broad flat hood, he darted most savagely after a dog,
and at a pace I should have thought impossible for anything
in the form of a snake. Returning by the hill, we
put up a fine leopard, or, as it is invariably called, a tiger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and got several shots as it bounded down the mountain
side, but, from the extraordinary way in which it
doubled and leaped, we all missed it.</p>

<p>December 31st.&mdash;A convoy of waggons from Fort
Beaufort, with supplies for our garrison, having come
within a few miles of us, and stuck fast at the foot of a
steep mountain road, called Botha's Rant, we went down
at dawn with all the available force that could be spared,
to their assistance. Each waggon had to be unloaded
before it could be moved a single foot up the steep slippery
path, and the men had every sack and barrel to
carry up to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the additional force of this
escort, we made a patrol into Kaal Hoek, where parties
of rebel Hottentots were said to be living on the deserted
farms. Bruce, with about two hundred infantry, took up
a position a few miles from the Post, on a high hill commanding
the country below; while I, with a party of
about twenty-five mounted men, made a circuit through
the valley from south to north, encountering some very
bad and dangerous ground. Several of the party got
severe falls in deep holes hidden by the long waving
grass that reached to our saddle girths; one entirely
disappeared, horse and all, in a collection of holes made
by the ant-bears, and dislocated his wrist. In fact, it
was always rather nervous work riding over these plains,
which every body does at a canter; for, independently
of the fall, if one happens to be in the rear of a party,
the chances are ten to one against the accident being
noticed; and then, as the horses usually take themselves
off on such occasions, the unlucky rider is left on foot
to the mercy of lurking Kaffirs, and probably with some
bodily hurt, or a broken rifle. This may account for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
rate at which such parties invariably ride, as every one
tries to keep his horse well up in front.</p>

<p>In our progress each deserted farm was surrounded
and carefully examined; but, though the spoor was
plentiful, it was nowhere less than two days old, and no
one was to be found. The crops had been carried off
half-ripe, and every fruit tree stripped bare. We came
in our route on the remains of the Tottie woman accidentally
killed by the Dutchmen; her skull and a few
rags were all that was to be seen. After a circuit of
about thirty miles, we returned to the Post, where we
found one of our men, M'Linden, at his last breath; he
died very soon after, having been ill only a few hours.
Two days previously he had helped in building a wall of
loose stones round the graves of our departed comrades
buried outside the fort, and now, before our work was
half completed, he had found his last resting-place in the
same enclosure. He was a brave soldier, and we followed
his body to the grave with real sorrow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
BUSHMAN PAINTINGS&mdash;LOCUSTS&mdash;RETURN Of TRANS-KEI EXPEDITION.</h2>


<p>Jan. 1st. 1852.&mdash;A small party of the Boers, who had
gone out in the morning to reconnoitre the Zuurberg
heights, on which the smoke of a Kaffir fire had been
visible all the previous day, returned in the afternoon
with the intelligence that they had been sharply engaged
with a much larger body of rebels, strongly posted among
the crags. They had killed three of the enemy, but were
obliged to abandon the attempt to dislodge them with so
small a party. It was determined to attack them at
early dawn the following morning. For this purpose
the Field-Cornet was ordered to warn all the Burghers
in his district to attend the rendezvous.</p>

<p>A couple of hours' riding brought us, by daybreak,
to the foot of the mountain. The ascent was commenced,
and soon became so steep that we had to dismount,
and lead our horses up its rocky slope, till at last
the large detached blocks became so frequent as to render
that impossible, and leaving them on a small open
plateau, with half a dozen men, we scrambled up the
rest of the ascent on our hands and knees. Our trouble
was in vain; for, after expecting at every step to be fired
on, we finally stood in their deserted nest, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
thickly strewn with remains of fruit, corn, and vegetables,
stolen from the gardens of the settlers in the
valley. It was a curious and well-concealed retreat,
under an enormous overhanging cliff, scored with the
Boers' bullets of the day before; a large mass of rock
and one or two thick bushes in front, making it nearly a
cavern. There was a regular cooking place of stones;
also a small cave for sleeping in, the floor being covered
with a bed of dry grass, evidently very lately used, and
stained here and there with blood. The smooth faces of
the rock in this cave as well as the other places were
covered with Bushmen paintings, not unlike in appearance
to some of those on the tombs of Egypt. For the
most part they represented animals of the chase, koodoo,
gemsbok, hartebeeste, &amp;c., with a dog or two, a man,
an assegai, or bow and arrows. The execution was very
good, and the colours, chiefly red, blue, black and white,
still retained their brightness, though the country has
been deserted by its former inhabitants, the Bushmen,
for many years. The Boers said there was another cave
at some distance, and high up on the same range, but
much larger, and completely covered with similar paintings;
but it was unsafe to visit it without a stronger
party, and we had too many patrols to allow our finding
either men or time for the purpose.</p>

<p>The Dutchmen believe them to be a century or two
old, and allege that the Bushmen worshipped them;
but though it is quite possible, yet there is no evidence
to show it; and they were probably nothing more than
a record of hunting achievements.</p>

<p>We had heard many persons speak of these paintings
as curiosities very rarely found, and that only in remote
districts, and were therefore as much surprised as
pleased at finding them so near, though certainly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a sufficiently out-of-the-way place. I made a hasty
sketch of some of them on the outside wrapper of a
packet of cartridge. The whole locality was most beautiful;
enormous detached masses of rock, scattered
around, and stupendous cliffs of a bright yellow and
orange colour, their crevices studded with bushes and
scarlet and pink ivy-leaved geranium.</p>

<p>At mid-day on the 9th, a large body of the enemy,
who had concealed themselves by night in the dry
bed of a mountain torrent, suddenly rushed from their
ambush, and having wounded a young man at work
near the house, before he could seize his gun, instantly
swept off the whole of Mynheer Rautenbach's horses,
cattle, and sheep. The sound of shots, and especially
the well-known "roer" of the old Dutchman, a huge
weapon carrying a 4 oz. ball, gave us the alarm at the
Post in a moment, though four miles off, for no idle
firing was permitted. The alarm was taken up by the
Fingoes on the look-out hills; the wall pieces at the
Fort were fired as a signal to the Burghers, and in less
than ten minutes a mounted party was rattling out
of the barrack square, and galloping down the road
amid clouds of dust. As we passed the two Laagers,
some were loading their roers, others buckling on their
powder-horns and pouches; while the "jungvrouws" were
saddling the fresh-caught horses, for their fathers, husbands,
and brothers; they soon overtook us by short
cuts, and as we swept past old Rautenbach's barricaded
house, our party was augmented to seventy or eighty
men. At a turn in the lovely valley, which opened before
us about a mile beyond the farm, we could see the
enemy; the green sloping summit of the Zuurberg on
our right, and half a mile further up the poort the
cattle driven along by a party of mounted Kaffirs. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
a shout of exultation we again dashed forward, rattling
along the road in an exciting chase; the long manes and
tails of the Dutchmen's horses streaming in the wind,
the bullets whistling over our heads from the Kaffir-crowned
heights, and the enemy before us straining every
nerve to reach a narrow gorge, called Tiger's Kloof, the
entrance to which was guarded by parties of their comrades
posted among the fort-like rocks on either side.
The ground presently became so full of hidden holes
that in three or four minutes, as many of our party were
down.</p>

<p>In the midst of our career, we came to a sudden
check at a deep drift, immediately under fire from a
"koppie"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> held by the rebels, who took deliberate aim
as we leaped from rock to rock, leading our horses
through the bed of the stream; but no one was hit,
though three of the horses were wounded. Without
waiting to form a party, each one as he mounted pushed
on up the Kloof after the cattle, the enemy still keeping
up a smart fire. As soon as all had fairly entered the
gorge, the Kaffirs on the heights hurried down to take
possession of its entrance, but a well directed fire from
the party dropped behind to hold the opposing rocks,
frustrated the attempt.</p>

<p>The sheep had fallen into our hands at the foot of the
mountain, and now the fugitives, closely pressed, abandoned
their spoil altogether, and many leaping from
their horses, in the hope of escaping on foot among the
rocks, were killed at close quarters, fighting bravely to
the last.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p>The stolen horses escaped us, having reached the edge
of the Zuurburg bush, but the whole of the oxen and
sheep were recaptured, and six of the enemy's horses
and some arms taken. Our own steeds were so completely
done up that many came to a stand-still, compelling
their riders to return a great part of the way on
foot. Mynheer Rautenbach was very glad to get so
much back again; but he deeply grieved over his nephew,
the young man who had been wounded by a charge of
"loopers," or slugs, which lodged in the shoulder joint.
His sufferings were very severe, and our surgeon pronounced
his recovery doubtful.</p>

<p>We were at this time visited by flights of locusts,
more numerous than had been known for years. They
came in such myriads as literally to darken the air,
passing over for hours together in one continued cloud,
stretching as far as the eye could see, and frequently
shutting out from view objects at the distance of a few
hundred yards. The sound of their flight was like the
wind; the plain was completely covered with them for
miles; and we moved through them with eyes half
closed and heads bent down as they were borne along
on the breeze. One while they looked like falling
snow, and the ground was whitened over as the sun
caught their wings in a particular light; another, they
appeared sweeping across the sky like a dark smoke.
Everything green disappeared in a few days, the young
crops were gone, and the pasturage vanished. But what
was not less extraordinary, every living thing in turn fed
on them. Not only did the horses and cattle greedily
devour the destroyers, and the dogs and poultry run
after them with open mouths, doubling and turning and
jumping off their feet in absurd attempts to catch them
in the air, but the Dutch and Hottentot servants fried
them in fat and eat them in quantities; the tribes up
the country live on them during the season, and lay by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
a stock of locust meal<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> for the winter, drying them in
the sun and pounding them between stones; but this is
less surprising among people who kipper snakes, and
store up bags of dried ants for family use. We tried
fresh locusts, both cooked and uncooked, but found
them, to say the least, very indifferent eating.</p>

<p>Our only communication with the world was by means
of our faithful Fingoes, who, assuming the Kaffir characteristics,
made their way down to Beaufort by secret
bush paths under cover of night. On these occasions,
which, except on emergencies, were only once a month,
the "post party," equipped for the road, came at nightfall
to our little whitewashed mess room for the mail;
their tall, dusky figures filling the doorway as they stood
folded in their blankets; the old chief, Umkye, a fine
fellow of six feet three, minus an eye, receiving the mail-bag
with many injunctions about its safety. Lingering
at the door, the party invariably cast wistful glances at
the bottles on the table, when, perhaps, some one, egged
on by the rest, would venture to say, with assumed
gravity, "Plenty cold night, Baas," and then (as all
Kaffirs and Fingoes do) put the end of his thumb between
his teeth, in a half deprecatory half-frightened
manner. But finding the hint not taken, would return
to the attack,&mdash;"Kleine sopie goot für de brieffe" (A
little drop will be good for the mail). The thumb in
the mouth again; "Banyou, Amakosa in de padt, Baas;
ein bidtge sopie make big heart" (plenty of Kaffirs in
the way, sir; a little dram, &amp;c. &amp;c.). The glistening eyes
and animated expression that accompanied the pouring
out the coveted dram, and the gusto with which the
last drop was drained, would have made a fine subject
for the pencil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<p>Their dislike to this duty was extreme; and unless
old Umkye, whose authority none of them dared dispute,
were of the party, ten to one the big hearts would
get so small on approaching the bush, that they were
pretty sure to turn back. On one occasion we found
out that the rascals had only gone a few hundred yards
from the Fort, and sitting down under the shelter of
some rocks, indulged themselves with a pipe for a couple
of hours, declaring, when they returned, that they had
fallen in with Kaffirs, and barely escaped with their
lives. Their escape, however, not being viewed in the
light they had anticipated, they were consigned to the
guard-room for the remainder of the night, and in the
morning, their foot-prints having been tracked, they
were told, very much to their surprise (never suspecting
white men of tracing spoor), where they had been and
what they had done, and were also given to understand
that they would be kept prisoners till nightfall, when,
though they had shown themselves rascals, they would
graciously be permitted the undeserved privilege of
proving they were not "amafazi" (women), and would
be allowed to set off again. But they had really several
narrow escapes, having been once or twice attacked and
dispersed by war parties, and owing their escape solely
to the darkness of the night and their intimate knowledge
of the bush paths. Their journey this month with
our letters for the English mail was the last for poor old
Umkye; the post-party was waylaid by the Kaffirs, and
he was killed; the rest, dispersed in all directions, escaping
by superior activity, one to the Blinkwater, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to the Rifle Brigade camp, and one to Post Retief,
bringing the news to the chief's wife. We were startled
from sleep, about six in the morning, by the most unearthly
yells and howls in the barrack-square, all the
women joining the widow and her family in their accustomed
wild lament. We were deeply grieved at his
loss. His amusing and eccentric habits, his respectful
manner, and regular attendance at our Church service,
had made him a great favourite. Though he could not
understand a word of English, he never missed coming
to service on Sunday; but could never be induced to
venture further than the door, where he sat cross-legged
on the floor, stood in a reverential posture, or knelt
prostrate with his face on the ground. At his own kraal
he nightly collected his household, and prayed and sung
a hymn with them. His loss was longer regretted at
the Post, if not more deeply felt, than by his wife; for
when we gave her a cow and calf, her grief seemed
to be forgotten in the calculation of their probable
value.</p>

<p>Rautenbach's nephew continuing in a very precarious
state, we rode over constantly to see him, taking any
little thing in the way of delicacies that we had, though
poor was the best. One day we found them thrashing
out maize in the house; five or six Dutch Boers with
pipes in their mouths, and one or two odoriferous Fingoes
sat cross-legged on the stone floor round a heap of
"cobs," hammering away at it with keeries&mdash;the grains
flew all about the room, hitting the clock, the windows,
and the glasses, and striking one in the face in a most
unpleasant manner. All the time we were talking to the
Baas we were screwing up our eyes and ducking our
heads, though the old man did not seem to mind it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the least, never winking even, unless actually hit in the
eye. The noise could not have been very soothing to
the wounded youth, who lay in a dark room adjoining,
the window, like all the rest, being bricked up outside
for defence. He was in great pain, and evidently sinking
fast; two days afterwards death released him from
his sufferings, adding another victim to the long list of
murdered settlers.</p>

<p>The long dry grass having about this time been accidentally
or purposely set on fire by the enemy, the plains
around were burning for several days, nothing arresting
the course of the flames except a road or a stream.
During the day-time a dense cloud of smoke hung over
the country; at night the sky was lurid from the blaze,
and the effect was magnificent, whole mountain sides
and countless thousands of acres presenting one sheet of
flame. Nothing could be more dreary and desolate
than the endless tracts of blackened country which the
conflagration left behind.</p>

<p>January 11.&mdash;The Trans-Kei expedition returned at
this date to King William's Town, after six weeks in
the field without tents, and exposed to deluges of rain
among high grass. The refractory and treacherous
chief, Kreli, had been severely punished; many of his
men killed; 30,000 head of cattle taken; 14,000 goats,
and a great number of horses; besides 7000 Fingo
slaves liberated, and brought away with their cattle,
amounting to 30,000 more, all which had, of course, virtually
belonged to Kreli. This crushing blow on the
paramount chief of all the Kaffirs, produced a most
salutary effect through the whole of Kaffirland.</p>

<p>On the last day of the month, a commando of
mounted Boers having joined us from Tarka the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
day, we started at 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, with all our available horsemen,
the party altogether about 100 strong, to patrol the
Koonap district. It was a fine moonlight morning, and
as, for the first few miles, silence was not necessary, we
trotted along with a cheerful sound of horses' hoofs,
clanking stirrups, and jingling arms, mingled with a
Babel of tongues, English and Dutch, Gaelic, broad
Scotch, and Fingo. On reaching Kaal Hoek, and finding
that we were a little too early, we off-saddled, and
in silence, each one at his horse's head, waited for daylight,
in front of a belt of wood on the hill-side, which
echoed with the cries of wild pintados, as the sky
brightened with the coming dawn.</p>

<p>We rode round by Bushneck, and from the heights
could see a few stray Kaffirs moving across the Waterkloof
valley far below. Thence we proceeded, over hill
and plain, under a burning sun, through the Koonap
district, passing many deserted farms, their orchards
bent down with the weight of unheeded fruit, and
threading our way by deep bush and eddying river, where,
excepting the chattering of the flocks of brilliant scarlet
bunting,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which built their pensile nests, and flitted
among the tall papyrus, the silence and solitude were oppressive.
Now and then we came on the print of naked
feet and the remnants of half eaten prickly-pears, but
the spoor was old, and consequently useless. On many
of the mimosas, we observed large clusters of a very
beautiful parasitical plant, a <i>Loranthus</i>, with dark glossy
leaves, and orange coloured flowers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>After having descended the side of a steep rocky
mountain where it was necessary to alight and lead our
horses, I was in the act of remounting, when my horse
suddenly started off at a gallop, and taking the bit in his
mouth, left me at his mercy, with one foot in the stirrup
and a loaded rifle in my hand. The saddle being loose,
turned round, and after a short but mad career, down we
came on the stones with a crash that made the sparks fly
from my eyes; the next moment I found myself in the
centre of a ring of kind-hearted Boers, eager to render me
assistance; one trying to mend my favourite rifle, which
was smashed to pieces, others offering water, and two or
three feeling me all over, to ascertain whether any bones
were broken. Happily I had not sustained any serious injury,
though sufficiently severe to render me very unequal
to the exertion of riding thirty miles further in the sun,
over a country becoming at every step more rugged and
difficult. Sometimes we had to cross roaring drifts of
the Koonap with slippery shelving rocks, that frequently
launched horse and rider into deep eddying pools; or, bent
double on the saddle-bows, pushed our way through
thorny thickets of <i>vacht um bidtge</i>,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> prickly-pear, and
mimosa, occasionally creeping round some precipitous
scaur, by a narrow and crumbling track, where a false step
of our nimble and active steeds would have hurled us
into the river beneath.</p>

<p>The sun was so hot, that my leg and thigh, from
which the trews had been completely torn, became
blistered by its burning rays, and continued very painful
for many days after.</p>

<p>At Viljoens farm, we surprised a small party of
Kaffirs robbing and destroying. A brisk scrimmage
took place; three or four of them were killed, and some
women captured, whom we liberated after getting all
the information we could out of them, which was, as
usual, very little.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<p>Never had the sight of the little fort been more welcome
than on that sultry evening, after sixteen hours
patrolling over more than fifty miles of broken country,
and the last thirty miles of it in great pain. I did not
leave my bed for many days; the heat of the weather,
and the peculiar tendency of the atmosphere to aggravate
every wound, however trivial, rendering mine both
tedious and troublesome.</p>

<p>A few days after our return, some little excitement
was caused in our isolated community, by the report of a
mounted party approaching through the glen. It proved
to be a patrol from the Blinkwater camp, which, having
fallen in with the enemy, and captured twelve horses,
and killing also sundry Kaffirs without any casualty on
their own side, had been prevented returning by the
timely and fortunate discovery that their pass was "forelaid"
by a very strong body of the enemy; consequently
they had made for our post, which they reached safely
with all their booty, completely outwitting the cunning
savages.</p>

<p>Once more able to mount my horse, I rejoined our
patrols, which were fully occupied in pursuing and
waylaying the enemy, who, in small detached parties,
made their appearance first on one side, then on another,
in vain attempts to seize the government cattle; upwards
of a thousand head being generally kept here in
reserve. On clear bright days we were tolerably secure,
as we could then discover with the glass, the solitary
blanketted spy, perched on some lofty crag of the
Didama or little Winterberg; but when their summits
were hidden, and the clouds rolled half way down their
sides, and hung there motionless, we were all on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
<i>qui vive</i>, for the crafty Kaffirs, creeping down under the
vapoury cover, would exchange shots with the cattle
guard, or herdsmen, even though they did not venture
to make a dash for the cattle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
DESTRUCTION OF KAFFIR CROPS&mdash;FIFTH ATTACK ON WATERKLOOF.</h2>


<p>Sir H. Smith, on the return of the Kei expedition,
having laid his plans for clearing the Waterkloof of
the enemy, who had collected there during his absence,
issued a public proclamation in the early part of this
month, February, ordering all Burghers on the frontier,
between twenty and fifty years of age, to assemble by the
9th of next month, under the old commando system,
to aid the troops in expelling the enemy from their
stronghold; warning all colonists at the same time that,
failing compliance, themselves must bear the responsibility
of their apathy.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this incentive, which one would
hardly have supposed necessary for men the safety and
preservation of whose families and private property were
at issue, they made, generally speaking, a most mean
and pitiful response to the command. One or two districts,
that of Albert in particular, being alone exceptions
to what Sir H. Smith termed their "melancholy
shuffling."</p>

<p>At the latter end of the month, the troops were despatched,
armed with scythes, old swords, and reaping
hooks, to destroy the half ripe crops of the Kaffirs in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Amatola country, from whence they obtained the supplies
that enabled them to carry on the harassing war.
Immense quantities were destroyed at the sources of the
Upper Keiskamma, in the "Wolf's Den" (Sandilli's <i>home-farm</i>),
in the Gulu valley, the Amatola basin, the
Zanooka valley, and the Chumie, including the 'gardens'
of the chief Soga, the treacherous murderer of the
military villagers in that district.</p>

<p>Though none of the Kat River missionaries openly
expressed any feelings of compassion or indignation at
this wholesale demolition of the poor Kaffir's crops, their
mouth-piece, Mr. Renton, took the pains to concoct a
very touching tale about some potatoes, affirmed by
him to have been stolen from one of their own gardens
by our inhuman and wicked Highlanders. This
story, circumstantially related on a visit to Scotland,
greatly affected his audience at an assembled synod, to
our great amusement, at the expense of their wasted
sympathies, when we afterwards heard of it. The fact
was, that the garden being in the enemy's country, of
course the crops in it had to share the same fate as the
rest; but, just as its destruction commenced, special
counter-orders were issued to spare it, and payment
was offered by the soldiers for the little which had
been taken; the money being refused, was thrown on
the ground.</p>

<p>B&mdash;&mdash;, who had been absent for a couple of days,
returned in the evening of the 5th March, with a glorious
budget of news and English letters. We learned
from him that a sharp skirmish had taken place under
General Somerset, three days before, in the Waterkloof,
in which they had killed about thirty Kaffirs, and destroyed
two villages, capturing eighty head of cattle
and thirty horses. Lieut.-Col. Yarborough, 91st Regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and Captain Bramley, Cape Mounted Rifles, had
been severely wounded, Ensign Herbert slightly; and
eight men of the 74th Highlanders killed and wounded,
besides several of the 91st and Cape Corps.</p>

<p>The Rifle Brigade had arrived from England, and fresh
drafts for the different regiments were reported to have
reached the Cape in the "Birkenhead," including sixty-six
rank and file for us, with our new Lieut.-Col. Seton, and
Ensign Russell. Only two days after hearing of the safe
arrival of our draft and other reinforcements in the
"Birkenhead," we were startled by the sad and astounding
intelligence of her total wreck off Simon's Bay, and
the loss of nearly all on board in a calm sea, and within
sight of the shore. From the moment she struck on a
hidden rock till she broke up and sank, barely twenty
minutes elapsed; during which, however, by the noble
and generous exertions of the troops, the whole of the
women and children were got off, when she parted and
went down, all the brave fellows steadily performing
their duty to the last. According to the report of Captain
Wright, 91st Regiment, one of the few survivors&mdash;"there
is no doubt most of the men in the lower troop
deck were drowned in their hammocks. The rest appeared
on deck, when Lieut.-Col. Seton called the
officers about him and impressed upon them the necessity
of preserving order and silence among the men.
Every one did as he was directed, and there was not a
murmur or a cry amongst them until the vessel made
her final plunge. All received their orders and had them
carried out as if the men were embarking instead of
going to the bottom. There was only this difference,
that never was an embarkation conducted with so little
noise or confusion."</p>

<p>Out of 14 officers and 458 men on board, no less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
9 officers and 349 men were lost, besides the crew;
5 officers and 109 men alone escaped to shore by swimming,
or clinging to the drift-wood. Not a single woman
or child was lost, all being carefully shipped into the
cutter-boat and safely landed. Of the 74th Highlanders,
Colonel Seton, Ensign A. C. Russell, and 48 men,
nearly the whole draft, unhappily perished,&mdash;18 only
escaping to shore. Colonel Seton had only heard
at the Madeiras of the death of his gallant senior,
Colonel Fordyce, and his own appointment to the
command of the regiment. He was a man of great and
varied attainments, being especially distinguished as a
linguist and mathematician.</p>

<p>Russell, though he had joined the depôt at Kinsale
after the regiment had left for the Cape, was well known
to us by report for his gentlemanly, amiable, bearing,
and high principle. His untimely end was keenly felt by
those of his brother officers who had personally known
him, and lamented by all. In those last awful moments
he was noticed carrying out the commands of his Colonel
with noble courage and undisturbed composure.</p>

<p>Our letters from home, doubly welcome in our
mountain solitude, kept us up till a late hour. The
<i>Illustrated News</i> and <i>Punch</i> never before seen in
those regions, were wisely economised for another day, as
we could not afford to exhaust a month's amusement at
one sitting.</p>

<p>March 8th.&mdash;About midnight, as we sat on the "stoep"
of the officers' quarters, smoking in silence, and enjoying
the cool, soft night air, watching the while the bright
stars of the "Southern Cross," that sparkled above the
jagged peak of the Didama, a distant bugle sounded the
"cease firing." Our bugler being summoned by the
sentry on the wall, the "advance" rang out clear on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
night air, softly echoing from rock to rock. In a few
minutes the clattering of horses was heard rapidly approaching;
and the challenge of the sentinel, from whose
platform we looked on a mass of horsemen, was answered
by the familiar voice of the gallant Tylden. He had
come with a large force of mounted men to be in readiness
to move with us in the combined attack on the
Waterkloof to which we were anxiously looking forward.</p>

<p>The second Division, recruited and re-equipped after
the Kei expedition, marched from King William's Town to
Fort Beaufort, to join General Somerset's division at the
Blinkwater, and take their share in the assault. The
order of attack (made known only to the officers in command)
was to be as follows:&mdash;The right column, under
Lieut.-Col. Eyre, consisting of four guns; a Rocket
troop; the 43rd Light Infantry; the 73rd Regiment
and two companies of the 74th Highlanders; with detachments
of Native Levies; was to move from the
Blinkwater Post, dislodge the enemy from Fullers
Hoek, and attack Macomo's "Den" on the ridge.</p>

<p>The centre column, under Lieut.-Col. Michell, consisting
of two guns; the 6th Regiment; four companies
of the 45th; the 60th Rifles; and Native Levies;
was to ascend the Kromme Heights from Blakeway's
farm, by the Wolfsback Ridge, and attack the bushy
kloof connecting Fullers Hoek with the Waterkloof.</p>

<p>The left column, under Lieut.-Col. Napier, two guns,
four companies of the 74th Highlanders, the 91st Regiment,
150 Cape Mounted Rifles, 200 Fingo Levies, and
all Burghers that might show themselves, was to move
up the valley of the Waterkloof from Bushneck to its
head, and thence ascend to meet the attack of the centre
column, leaving a mounted body to cut off any dislodged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
parties endeavouring to escape from one Kloof to
another.</p>

<p>The 12th Lancers and a detachment of Cape Corps
under Lieut.-Col. Pole, were to be stationed at the ruined
settlement of Hertzog, to cut off the retreat of the
enemy to the Amatolas; and our party from Post Retief,
about 160 mounted men, was to patrol on the Waterkloof
heights to intercept the retreat of the enemy or their
cattle in that direction. All these bodies were to be at
their appointed positions on the 9th, ready to move at
daylight next morning.</p>

<p>The day following the arrival of Tylden's party was necessarily
a day of rest; for they had ridden thirty miles
across the mountains, and many of the horses were in a
very indifferent condition, not having recovered from the
hardships of the late expedition into Kreli's country.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 10th, the whole party,
having mustered in the barrack square, marched out,
winding along the little glen, a body of rough looking
but gallant and business-like fellows. Just as they
reached the heights, the first boom of artillery was heard
in the direction of Fullers Hoek, announcing the commencement
of operations, and soon a brisk cannonade and
rattle of musketry, was followed by more distant reports
from the south and west, as the two other columns advanced
on their respective routes. For some time our horsemen
had little or nothing to do, as the enemy were naturally
drawn towards the points, so unexpectedly attacked,
but as they were forced back by the advance of Colonel
Napier's column in the Kloof below, they drove their
cattle up its steep forest clothed sides to the summit,
where their intended escape into the opposite valley
of the Kat River was frustrated by the unlooked for
presence of the Post Retief detachment, which, exchanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
rapid shots with the astonished Kaffirs, and
following them into the bush to which they again quickly
retreated, brought out many of their cattle, and gave
them such a rough handling, that those who escaped it
preferred remaining under cover and taking their chance
from the advancing skirmishers below. After this, distant
shots only could be obtained; yet having in the party
several of the best marksmen in the country, not a Kaffir
within half a mile showed himself a second time. No
one who has not seen it could believe, either the accuracy
with which many of the officers and Burghers to
whom I refer, and could name, would hit an object at
that distance with a rifle ball, or the extraordinary practice
they make at much greater ranges.</p>

<p>Rifle shooting and rifles, our main arm in this guerilla
warfare, were of course the subjects of constant discussion;
target shooting was incessantly going on while in camp,
and a rifle never out of our hands on the march, so that
every tyro became in a wonderfully short time a fair
marksman, and, many, first-rate shots. The distribution
of Minié rifles to the troops excited great emulation
amongst the men also, which was increased by our giving
shilling and half-crown prizes for inner circle and bull's-eye
hits. At first, six of the new weapons were distributed
in each company to the best shots, but the
number was afterwards increased, as fresh supplies were
sent out to us.</p>

<p>Scarcely a mail-steamer arrived from England without
bringing some new improvement in fire-arms; smooth
bore, two groove, four groove, and polygroove, half and
quarter twist, rifle barrels; conical balls, plain and winged,
sharp pointed and rounded, with wooden plugs or iron
cups, concave and convex bases, &amp;c., were each in turn
tested, discussed, advocated, or rejected, affording a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
never-failing topic of interest and conversation; but after
all our experimental trials, there were nearly as many
advocates of each improvement as there were varieties;
the only points in which all agreed was, the decided
superiority of the conical ball generally, and the admirable
efficiency of the weapons so opportunely sent out for
the troops.</p>

<p>The ordinary range for target practice was from 500
to 800 yards, at which distance the men generally put
in two out of five rounds, the target being a white board
six feet high by three broad. At 900 yards, or more than
half a mile, one shot out of seven hit on an average,
the rest ploughing up the dust so near, that it must
have been anxious work for the target; even at three
quarters of a mile, we were able to disperse small
"clumpjies" of Kaffirs and cattle.</p>

<p>For four succeeding days, the Columns completely
traversed every part of the Blinkwater, Fullers Hoek,
Kromme, and Waterkloof. Our party was during the
same time patrolling on the heights of these mountain
ranges, preventing escape on the part of the enemy;
cutting off such small parties as, more daring than the
rest, attempted it; capturing horses and cattle, and skirmishing
along the whole eastern ridge of the Waterkloof.
The operations of the different columns had been
most successful; one after another, the whole of the
enemy's positions had been taken. On the first day,
Lieut.-Col. Eyre's column, in eight parties of attack,
ascended the steep and difficult paths of Fullers Hoek,
and driving the enemy before them, in spite of a stout
resistance, crowned the summits and destroyed their
villages. On the second day he attacked "the Den,"
celebrated as the especial and private stronghold of
Macomo, said indeed to be impregnable. The entrance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
a sort of natural stair in the rocks, had been discovered
to us by a female prisoner. All the guns were brought
to bear against it, and their fire told fearfully among the
defenders. The place was carried, and in its recesses
were found 130 women; among them, Macomo's <i>Great
Wife</i>, a royal Tambookie of considerable importance in
the tribe, together with several others standing in the
same relation to him, though less distinguished. Among
the rocks were quantities of apparel and provisions, with
powder, lead, and bullet-moulds. The whole of the
women were taken off prisoners, and the <i>Den</i> completely
destroyed. Twenty dead bodies of Kaffirs were
found, killed by the guns, independently of those that
fell in the assault. We had the misfortune to lose a
gallant young officer, Lieutenant the Hon. H. Wrottesley,
43rd Light Infantry, who was mortally wounded, and
died afterwards in camp; three men of the 73rd were
also killed, and some wounded.</p>

<p>During this attack, Colonels Napier and Michel
ascended respectively the Kromme and Waterkloof
heights, dragging their guns by dint of incredible exertions
up almost impracticable steeps (the former being
sharply engaged), drove the rebels from their positions,
and then, acting in concert, destroyed all their
kraals.</p>

<p>On the 15th, Colonel Napier captured 130 head of
cattle and many horses, taking fifty women and children
prisoners, and killing several of the rebels. The 60th
Rifles, under Captain the Hon. A. Hope, attacking
the Iron Mountain, on which the enemy took his final
stand, forced them from the position with fixed swords,
and they were pursued and driven over the Krantzes,
with great loss, by the remainder of the 60th, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Major Bedford, 560 head of cattle and 75 horses falling
into their hands.</p>

<p>After this the enemy fled through the country in all
directions, making chiefly for the Amatolas.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the above combined movements,
an attack, with like success, had been made by Lieut.-Col.
Perceval, on the Chief, Stock, in the Fish River
bush.</p>

<p>While Captain Tylden and his Burghers were still with
us at Post Retief, the friendly Kaffir Chief, Kama, a
faithful and valued ally of the government, arrived with
a retinue on his way back to his village, after an interview
with the Governor-General, and encamped outside
the walls for the night. He accepted with great politeness
our invitation to mess. He had been to request
His Excellency not to make peace with the Gaikas or
Kreli, until the whole of the former had crossed the
Kei. In the progress of the war he took the most lively
interest; and though his <i>Great Wife</i> was sister to Macomo,
expressed his anxiety to see him vanquished and
driven from his stronghold. He had left his own
territory previous to the commencement of the last war,
disapproving of the intentions of his countrymen, and
feeling his consequent insecurity among them. His
lands he placed in the hands of the British Representative
to hold in trust for him, and with about 200 families
of his tribe, removed into the colony, residing at this
time at Kamastone, a location assigned him near Whittlesea.
He had done good and faithful service through
the whole of the present war, taking the field with his
sons and all his fighting men, of whom many had been
killed by the enemy. He appeared at dinner in a black
coat and a <i>clean shirt</i>; behaved in a quiet, self-possessed
manner; took wine, and used his knife and fork as if he
had been familiar with such things all his life. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
appetite, or politeness, was wonderful, taking everything
that was offered him; and if he was not ill after it, his
digestion was not less so.</p>

<p>Sir H. Smith marched from the Blinkwater camp on
the 17th with the Second Division under his own immediate
command, to attack a body of Rebels and Kaffirs
who, under the Chief Tyali, had taken up a position in
the Chumie, General Somerset at the same time following
up the flying enemy towards the N.E. frontier.
As a natural consequence of the breaking up of their
main body, the country was filled with scattered parties,
robbing and attacking the settlers everywhere, so that
our duties in patrolling became more than ever arduous;
hardly a day passed in which we did not go out, and
few patrols returned without having had some affair
on hand.</p>

<p>A six-pounder gun, with its complement of artillerymen,
was despatched for our garrison from Beaufort, to
shell the impervious ravines in which we could occasionally
see the Kaffirs from the table-land above. At
two in the morning we went with a party of seventy men
to the top of the Blinkwater Pass to meet it. While
waiting there, we could distinctly hear the Kaffirs and
their dogs in the forest below. Presently our ears recognised
the echoing report of the waggon whip, which
gradually neared, and soon the red coats of the 91st
came in sight on an open piece of road at our feet. As
we returned to the Post with our new acquisition, we
put up whole coveys of partridges, though our rifle and
pistol practice at them did not add much to the larder.</p>

<p>Next day we went out to shell a cluster of deserted
wood-cutters' huts, down in the valley below Bothas
bush, which had, the day before, been reported as inhabited
by the Kaffirs. Three or four shells burst right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
over them. One or two Kaffirs were seen, by the glass,
making their escape; and two others catching a couple
of horses, that looked at the distance, no bigger than
dogs. In less than five minutes after the report of the
gun, the thick smoke of a Kaffir signal (one can hardly
call it a fire) ascended in the still air at a distance of
about eight miles, and very soon after three or four
others rose in succession on the more distant ranges.</p>

<p>On the 7th April, Lieut.-General Cathcart, the newly-appointed
Governor-General assumed the command; and
Sir Harry Smith, our gallant and highly-esteemed
General, published his farewell, General Order:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
<i>"Head-Quarters, King William's Town,<br />
"April 7, 1852.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"His Excellency Lieut.-General the Hon. George
Cathcart having been appointed by the Queen to relieve
me, I this day relinquish the command.</p>

<p>"Brother Officers and Soldiers. Nothing is more painful
than to bid farewell to old and faithful friends. I
have served my Queen and country many years, and
attached as I have ever been to gallant soldiers, none
were ever more endeared to me than those serving in
the arduous campaign of 1851-52 in South Africa. The
unceasing labours, the night marches, the burning
sun, the torrents of rain, have been encountered with
a cheerfulness as conspicuous as the intrepidity with
which you have met the enemy in so many enterprising
fights and skirmishes in his own mountain fastnesses
and strongholds, and from which you have ever driven
him victoriously.</p>

<p>"I leave you, my comrades, in the fervent hope of laying
before your Queen, your country, and his Grace the
Duke of Wellington, these services as they deserve,
which reflect so much honour upon you.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>"Farewell, my comrades; your honour and interests
will be ever far more dear to me than my own.</p>

(Signed) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<span class="smcap">H. G. Smith.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"A. T. Cloete, Quartermaster-General."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the same day, and just before the relinquishment
of his command, news arrived of the successful exertions
of the columns patrolling in the Amatolas; Major-Gen.
Somerset's having killed upwards of 100 of the enemy,
and captured 3120 head of cattle, 70 horses and 1500
goats. The escort bringing the report of this patrol, fell
in with a party of the enemy, whom they gallantly attacked,
and took from them 198 head of cattle and 5
horses. At the same time Lieut.-Col. Eyre's column acting
in combination with that of the General, captured 800
head of cattle and 15 horses, from a formidable position
in the Amatolas; though with the loss of one officer,
Captain Gore, 43rd Light Infantry, killed at the head
of his company, and six men wounded.</p>

<p>For the next week or ten days we were out almost
daily patrolling the mountains, following up marauding
parties, and shelling the kloofs. On one of these duties
we had ridden to the top of the northern spur of the
little Winterberg to reconnoitre the Koonap valley;
sweeping the vast bush-dotted plain with the telescope,
we spied about twenty Kaffirs, at a distance of some
four miles or more, making across from Viljoens towards
the Waterkloof. We determined to cut them
off, and at once led our horses down the mountain
side into the bushy kloof, by a rocky and difficult
descent; and scrambling out on the opposite side
through the thorny bushes, galloped across the plain
for some miles, till we struck on their spoor, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
followed for a mile farther, where, leaving the road, it
became lost in the grass. After having proceeded as far
as we thought it possible for them to have got in the
interim, and seeing nothing of them on the immense
undulating plain, we concluded they must have observed
us, and taken refuge in some of the isolated patches of
bush scattered over it like islands. As the sun was
already low, we were just about turning our steps homeward,
when we suddenly espied them, about a mile off
on our right, leisurely ascending out of a grassy
hollow. Separating into two little parties to surround
them, Bruce leading one, I the other, we went
full speed down hill over the rough broken ground
at a break-neck pace, keeping an eye on them to note if
they observed us. But though neither stone nor bush
intervened they never perceived us till within 500 yards,
when throwing away their skin sacks, off they started
like the wind, making for a distant narrow belt of wood,
under cover of which and the rapidly approaching darkness,
they hoped to give us the slip. The pace was killing,
and we had yet nearly half a mile to make up before
we could intercept them. The chase became most exciting,
as we took flying, yawning sluits five or six feet
deep. At last two of them gave in, but perceiving them
to be women, we held on in pursuit of the others, firing
an occasional shot. Just as they gained the cover we
dashed up, and springing from our panting horses, followed
them into the tangled underwood, leaving a few
outside the belt to watch if they broke cover. But the
gloom of the trees, increased by the rapidly approaching
night, made our progress slow and difficult, and
though we worked completely through the bush they
escaped us.</p>

<p>We were now fourteen miles from the Fort, and taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
with us our two prisoners, returned at a foot's pace; one
of them, a Totty, was the wife of Speelman Kievet, one
of the most notorious of the Rebel leaders. The other
was a Madagascar slave, hideously ugly. On our way
we picked up the skin sacks that had been thrown away;
they were full of half-ripe fruit and meelies. It was
9 o'clock when we reached the Post, where our long absence,
for we had been out since noon, had caused much
uneasiness, as mounted Kaffirs had been seen through
the telescope, hovering about us on the higher ridges of
the mountain we had ascended. When we made our
appearance, two parties, one of mounted Boers, and the
other of infantry, were on the point of setting off to
search for us, or our remains; the latter being supposed
the more probable issue, as it was fully thought that we
must have been surrounded and massacred; judging,
however, in case we should return alive, that we should
be uncommonly hungry, our friends had judiciously reserved
dinner, or, more correctly, supper for us, which
we lost no time in sitting down to.</p>

<p>The night following, at 12 o'clock, we marched out of
the Fort with the gun and artillerymen, ninety rank and
file, and a guide, for Engelbrecht's Kloof, a difficult
wooded retreat, in which the enemy were said to be
lurking. On the way we had some sport with a couple
of porcupines, the dogs in front barking violently
at some object which they evidently had at bay; I
rode forward with the guide, but it was so dark that
we had some difficulty in finding their whereabouts.
One of them kept our dogs at a respectful distance,
rattling his tail on the ground and shaking his quills;
but he was soon despatched and hanging on the gun-limber.
We preserved his tail, which was quite a
curiosity, a bunch of short truncated hollow quills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
stuck on a lump of flesh. No animal of its size is so
easily killed; a tap on the head finishes him at once;
they are very common throughout the country, as is
proved by the quantities of quills one sees everywhere.
The flesh is excellent; very white and tender, and not
unlike young pig. The orthodox mode of cooking this
delicacy is to roast it in hot wood ashes, with the skin
on, minus the quills, of course.</p>

<p>After an eighteen miles' march, we halted as day was
breaking, at the top of the kloof. We shelled the
ravine; and the Levies advancing from the other side
of the valley received the Kaffirs thus dislodged; six
of whom, after a slight skirmish, were killed. As we
returned, the heat of the noontide sun on the open plain
was intense.</p>

<p>Riding out next day to reconnoitre at "the Springs,"
as we looked down into the valley, we saw two or three
horses grazing, and could discern by the glass several
Kaffirs in blankets, lying outside some huts half hidden
by the bush, at the edge of which they were built. As
the glen was unapproachable except by a detour of many
miles, we fired one or two conical balls at about 1000
yards, which made them jump up pretty quickly, and
seek the shelter of the wood. Having ascertained the
range as nearly as possible, we rode home, purposing to
give them a warmer dose at early dawn. Accordingly,
at 3 o'clock, I started with the gun and sixty rank
and file; a fine moon lighting us on the way. B&mdash;&mdash;,
following with thirty horsemen, overtook us, after two
hours' marching, just as we had halted and were getting
the gun into position. Their dark figures, seen sharply
against a patch of crimson sky at their backs, all around
being still in shadow, as they cantered towards us over
the intervening dusky level, had a singular and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
appearance. The moment it was light enough to
make out the position of the huts down in the dark
valley, we fired; the white wreaths of smoke from the
bursting shells below dispersing and vanishing before
the report reached us. Two parties of mounted men
rode off, one to the left, the other to the right, and
descended the mountain side as far as was practicable.
One or two horses were seen galloping down the glen,
and the huts were levelled with the ground.</p>

<p>April 17th.&mdash;Off with a mounted patrol by three
o'clock; overhead a lovely star-lit sky. We rode
along the elevated table-land, Kaffir fires blazing on the
higher mountains in every direction, and took an old
bridle path down the Blinkwater hill in preference to the
usual route, as less liable to ambuscade, leading our
horses down the slippery rocks, through close thorny bush.
Day breaking as we made our slow descent, showed two
or three wreaths of smoke, within musket shot, curling
up from Kaffir fires in the still forest beneath. No one
was to be seen, nor was a shot fired at us all the way,
as we kept slipping and sliding down the tiresome
descent, scratching hands and face, and tearing our
clothes among the 'vacht um bidgte' and 'num nyum'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
bushes.</p>

<p>Remounting on the flat below, we pushed on through
the bush at a good pace, till emerging on the open
plain glistening with dew in the morning sun, the
white tents of the Blinkwater camp came in sight. Our
sudden appearance, and Kaffir-like advance, made an
evident stir among the guards and sentries, and the few
officers about at that early hour assembled on the earthen
out-works; they were soon crowding round us for or with
news; tendering hairbrushes and towels at the riverside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>with pressing invites to speedy breakfasts&mdash;coffee,
ration beef, and biscuit.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>BLINKWATER<br />
(<i>and Waterkloof Heights</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>A couple of hours' rest for the horses, and we rode on
to Fort Beaufort, passing on our way the newly-made
grave of an Englishman, killed there a few days before.
It was the same spot where I had been attacked by the
rebels a few months previously.</p>

<p>Next day a party of officers from the garrison rode out
to meet the Rifle Brigade, just out from England, said
to be halted about six miles off, at Dans Hooght Hill.
They were inspanning their baggage train as we came
up, and about to march. To my surprise and delight I
encountered among the accompanying draft of officers
my brother, a young Ensign in the 74th, come out to
take his share in the toil and hazards of the campaign.
As we approached Beaufort our band and Pipers met the
new-comers, and preceded them through the town.</p>

<p>The day following, the head-quarters of the 74th
Highlanders marched in from the field, under Major
Douglas Patton, who, since the death of our lamented
Colonel, had been in command of the regiment. The
Rifles encamped on the green plain outside the Fingo
quarter of the town; and Beaufort, which had been
almost deserted, again swarmed with troops.</p>

<p>Leaving my brother in quarters, B&mdash;&mdash; and I turned
our faces once more towards our distant mountain fort,
riding by a short cut through the bush, off-saddling for
an hour at the Blinkwater camp to give our nags a roll
(as good as a feed of corn to a Cape horse), and then
striking off to the right, took our route by the eastern
valley, riding for about twelve miles along the wooded
banks of the Kat River, especially picturesque at this
point, with its alternate pools and rapids, and fringe of
weeping willows. Shortly after sundown, the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
fires of Colonel Napier's camp were seen ahead, and an
hour's stumbling along by broken paths and dangerous
drifts, in the most intense darkness, brought us nearly
within musket shot of the sentries. The 'cease firing'
and 'regimental call' of our bugle were answered, almost
before the echo had died away, by the 'advance,' and
we clambered up the rising ground on which the camp
was pitched, and soon found ourselves among old comrades,
whose familiar voice had not greeted us for
months. They had just returned from the Kei expedition,
and many were the hunting adventures they had
to tell, ample evidences of which were seen in the half-cured
skins, grass-stuffed heads, and quantities of horns
strewed about every tent.</p>

<p>On the following morning, after the luxury of a cold
bath under a fine fall of the Kat River, we set off for
Post Retief, making the ascent of the verdant Katberg
mountain by a path of extraordinary steepness; the heat
of the sun was overpowering. Three hours of uninterrupted
and most toilsome climbing, brought us to the
table-land above the beautifully-wooded ravine, Bothas
bush; off-saddling our panting horses at a clear spring
that bubbled out of the ground, we lay down to recover
our breath, feasting our eyes on the extensive view
below us.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th, in accordance with
orders from head-quarters, we marched from the Post
at five o'clock, having a party of artillerymen, sixty
rank and file, a 6 lbr. howitzer, and a waggon with tents,
tools, and rations. Our point was the dangerous Bushneck
Pass; our orders to cover the ascent of the Rifle
Brigade from that end of the Waterkloof. When
about half-way the waggon sunk so deep in a soft gully
that neither spades and picks, nor the appliance of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
extra span of oxen and a couple of score of fellows
yoked to the gun tow-ropes could move it, and it had
eventually to be unloaded.</p>

<p>As the valley below our position had showed no sign
of living creature all day, we retired in the evening to
Bear's Farm, a ruin about a mile off, where having
pitched our tents and picketted the mules and horses
among the blackened walls, we made a blazing fire and
prepared to pass the night as comfortably as we could.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock next morning the reconnoitering
party of Cape Corps, which had been sent at daylight
to the top of the Pass, returned with intelligence that
the Rifles were advancing up the valley with a large
train of waggons; our party was instantly in motion,
and, in a very short time back at its position on
the edge of the ridge commanding the Pass. While
the column was halting for breakfast about two miles
from us, we amused ourselves by looking at them
through the glass. The rows of piled arms glancing in
the sun; the smoke of the fires rising straight upwards
in the motionless air; white covered waggons peeping
through the green bush; herds of cattle, and multitudes
of dark figures moving about in all directions&mdash;in the
calm of a Sunday morning formed a picture which two
hours' gazing upon did not weary us with. At last
the faintly heard sound of bugle was followed by a
general movement in the bivouac; the oxen were
driven in, the confused masses of troops fell imperceptibly
into companies, and the companies into
column; while, as if by instinct, the oxen gathering into
groups, took their place at the waggons, and all was in
simultaneous motion. Another change as striking and
remarkable followed. The last waggon had scarcely
entered the bush and the rear-guard quitted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
ground, when the whole of it was dotted over with
Kaffirs, stealing in from every part of the bush, where,
unconscious of their nearness, the troops had so recently
been encamped. We counted thirty-five men, besides
women, gathered round the smouldering fires, searching
about for what they could find.</p>

<p>Nine hours we sat on the ridge, watching the
laborious and slow ascent of the column, a span of
eight and twenty cattle being required to bring each
waggon up. A few Kaffirs on the top of the hill, out
of range, chaffed them about their oxen, which they said
were "too swift and strong, and even dangerous," the
poor brutes being, in reality, half starved. It was dark
before one-half the train was up. Three companies of
the Rifles encamping on our position for the night, while
the remainder bivouacked below, left us at liberty to
return to the ruin and sleep in our tents.</p>

<p>Next morning the whole column under Colonel Buller,
encamped close to the ruins of Bear's farm, which
was to be a permanent position intended to keep a
check on the enemy in this quarter. Its proximity to
Post Retief, not more than two hours' ride, enabled us
frequently to see our friends of the gallant and renowned
old corps, and the oftener the more heartily welcome.</p>

<p>An application was made at this time, by the Masonic
body in Graham's Town, to have the remains of Lieut.-Colonel
Fordyce, and Lieutenants Carey and Gordon, of
the 74th Highlanders, interred there with suitable
honours, the two former having been members of the
fraternity. This was, of course, readily acceded to by
the regiment, who were not only gratified by the
request, but anxious themselves to show to the remains
that respect which duty in the field had prevented so
many from testifying at the first hurried interment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
The bodies were therefore exhumed and placed in lead
coffins, which we escorted for ten miles, to the top of
the Blinkwater Pass. There we were relieved by two
hundred of the 74th Highlanders, who escorted the
remains to the entrance of Fort Beaufort, where they
were met by Major-General Somerset and his Staff,
accompanied by a guard of honour of the head-quarters,
our own band, the Freemasons, and all the respectable
people of the place. The coffins, which had been
placed in the church for the night, were, on the following
day, escorted by the same guard of honour to
Graham's Town, where they were joined by a public
procession of the Freemasons and principal inhabitants,
and the remains of our brave comrades were consigned,
with military and Masonic honours, to their final resting
place.</p>

<p>A report arrived of a body of Rebels lurking in
Engelbrecht's Kloof, and a company of the Rifle Brigade
with three officers having joined us from their camp, we
marched from Post Retief, at three in the afternoon
(May 3rd), with a gun and about three hundred rank
and file, the intention being to make a combined attack
with the rest of the Rifles on the other side of the
position. A strong party of mounted men followed at
a couple of hours' interval.</p>

<p>Along the tortuous course of the Koonap, we had, in
the space of twelve miles, to wade through it no less
than seven times. Just after dark we halted at a ruined
and solitary farm house. The sentinels were posted, and
the men disposed amongst the ruins. We, after hunting
about for ourselves, found an outhouse of wattle and
daub, on which the thatch still remained. It was the
work of a moment to make a broom of green boughs,
sweep the mud floor, light a fire in the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
room, and arrange stones and boards to sit on; while the
servants, as quickly unloading the pack-horses, produced
our rations and grog, with tin plates, pewter spoons, and
cutlery to match. By our united efforts the meal was
soon ready; and though the coffee was as thick as
soup, and the beef tough as leather, we gathered, a
jovial party, round a table, extemporized out of an old
bedstead; our rifles, pistols, dirks, and belts, hanging on
the brightly illuminated walls, our own bush costume,
and the rough clad servants, busied at the bright fire in
the centre of the floor, produced quite a theatrical
effect. A kettle full of hot grog having been duly
concocted with Cape-smoke and freshly gathered limes,
we drew round the blazing logs and lighted our pipes.
Two old Dutch bedsteads, heavy wooden frames laced
across with strips of cow hide, which had escaped the
general destruction, were put in requisition for the
night; but as they would only accommodate two each,
and there were five of us, we <i>tossed up</i> who should be
the "odd man out," and Legge was soon stretched
asleep on the floor with a large stone under his head,
though half-devoured by fleas, which by the way always
infest a farm or kraal however long deserted.</p>

<p>At daylight the ground was white with hoar-frost,
and the air bitter cold; as we were drinking our
coffee by the fire a further reinforcement of mounted
Burghers rode up. In the next four hours' marching
we crossed eleven drifts, as on the day before, some
very dangerous from the deep pools, and the difficulty of
making sure footing as we jumped from one slippery
rock to another. Many of the men fell on the rocks, or
slipped into the water; one of the Rifle Brigade dislocated
his knee, while half the horsemen were tumbled
head over heels into the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>At nine o'clock, we came in sight of the other column
on the hill in front of us. The scouts returned with
information that the enemy had abandoned the kloof.
Our patrol was in vain, and we had nothing to do but
return. Joining the main column, we marched to
Bear's farm, and remained there the night.</p>

<p>The road by which commissariat supplies had to be
conveyed up to this elevated region had become so
dangerous, and nearly impassable, that a working party
was sent from the Blinkwater camp to repair it, and
we marched on the 5th, with a company of Rifles and
one gun, twelve miles to the head of the Blinkwater
hill, to cover and assist them. Having planted the gun,
and disposed our party on a height covering the road
below, we lighted a fire, and were breakfasting, when,
issuing from the edge of the forest, a long regular line,
of what we took to be Kaffirs, was seen moving across a
smooth open flat, about a mile off, and even after looking
at them through the glass, we were so convinced in
the correctness of our impression as to unlimber and
point the gun; nor was it till after several seconds' earnest
gaze that even the Fingoes, as well as ourselves, were
fully satisfied that it was a large troop of baboons of
immense size, so thoroughly human-like were their attitudes,
sitting, standing, and walking&mdash;"erectos ad sidera
tollere vultus."</p>

<p>We had with us a waggon containing pickaxes, spades,
and hatchets, to take our tour at repairing the road, and
went heartily to work, cutting down trees, and filling up
the immense deep ruts with felled timber, stones,
rocks, and earth. At three o'clock, a bugle, from the
covering-party on the heights above summoned us
from our labours, and we retraced the weary way back
to the Post, having accomplished twenty-six miles of
marching besides the day's work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>We returned to our work by dawn, but we had found
the distance so inconvenient, and adding so greatly to
the labour, that I had orders to pass the next night,
with my men, on the plain, so as to be nearer our work,
and accordingly we selected the ruins at Eastlands farm
for our bivouac. It was, however, only a choice of evils,
for the night was bitterly cold on this high ground, and
the darkness had come on so quickly that we had not
had time to collect sufficient fuel to keep us warm,
though we had had enough to show us that our little
party of thirty men was watched by mounted Kaffirs,
who, as the night closed in, hovered round nearer than was
quite agreeable. Having posted sentries and outlying
picquets, and made arrangements in case of an attack
which the Dutchmen with the waggon were confident
would be made, I sat down by my fire alone, but, finding
my own thoughts very indifferent company, soon
turned in, though the hyænas and jackals kept up
such a mournful howling that it was impossible to sleep.
Each morning a company of the Rifles joined us from
camp, and thus our labours were continued for nearly a
week, detached sections from the company on the
heights accompanying us as we worked lower and lower
down the hill.</p>

<p>A large drove of commissariat cattle ascended the
Pass one day for Colonel Buller's camp, and as they
came up I found it was escorted by a strong party of
troops and Fingo Levies, under my brother's charge.
Having handed them over to the Rifles, we had a
chat over the united contents of our haversacs, exchanging
the gossip of camp and post, after which he
left us to return to the Blinkwater; before he had gone
half a mile down hill we saw the Kaffirs creeping from
the mountain, as if to intercept the party at its foot, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
which, however, we gave him timely warning by a
Corporal's party of the Cape Corps.</p>

<p>Our principal amusements, besides acting as engineers,
and directing general proceedings, were sketching, and
rifle practice at the monkeys and lories hopping about
in the thick forest, and at the enormous vultures sleeping
on the high crags that towered above us on the opposite
side of the narrow ravine. Snakes were abundant here,
as indeed everywhere else, and among others we killed
a "boom slang," a long slender viper of a brilliant
grass green, which dropped from a tree under which we
had lighted a fire. This and the cobra and puff-adder
are the most deadly of all the snakes of the country, but
though they are all very common, and were frequently
found in our camps, we never once heard of a single accident
occurring among the troops, though Clifford, of
the Rifles, had a very narrow escape; one day sitting
with a party of officers on the ground, and carelessly
resting his hand on the grass, he felt something moving,
and turning round, to his surprise found he had got his
hand on the neck of a large puff-adder! without withdrawing
it, he coolly drew out his clasp knife with the
other, and severed the beast's head from its body.</p>

<p>Having finished our task, we returned once more to
Post Retief, where we found a large and jovial party of
the Rifle Brigade.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, on a cold morning, towards the close
of the month, a small party of us, bound for Fort Beaufort,
mounted our horses in the square of our little Fort,
and riding out of the gates, which were carefully secured
after us, proceeded down the glen along the rocky little
streamlet, that rushed and foamed past the Post. The
mountain peaks stood out sharp against the dark blue
sky; the stars shone brightly, and the clear air was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
so keen that we were glad to put our horses into a trot
to keep up the circulation. The party consisted only of
D. A. Commissary-General Bartlett, and myself, with
three after-riders; as our safety consisted more in
secrecy than numbers, our first object was to get down
before daylight. After a sharp ride of ten miles across
the table land, as we reached the crest of the hill the
first streaks of day were faintly visible, warning us that
we had no time to lose if we wished to clear the Pass.
Up to this point we had cantered carelessly along,
laughing and talking, but now it was necessary to be
cautious. Having tightened our saddle-girths and unslung
our rifles at the head of the shadowy road, which
with its overhanging trees looked like the entrance of a
dark cave, we proceeded in silence down the steep path
cut through the bush. We had gone but a few hundred
yards, our eyes hardly yet accustomed to the gloom,
when a dark figure crossed the road a little in front, and
disappeared in the bush. To have fired would only have
been to betray ourselves; so we held on our course,
keeping a sharp look out. When half way down we
came suddenly on a Kaffir fire in the bush on our left,
not more than five or six yards from the path; round
it lay several black fellows, rolled in their red blankets
and karosses, sleeping soundly, after watching probably
the greater part of the night. Almost at the same moment
the glimmer of a second fire showed through the
underwood on the opposite side of the road a little
beyond; holding up my hand to caution the escort, we
moved stealthily along, looking carefully to our horses'
feet and almost holding our breath. As we passed the
second fire, round which also lay the sleeping forms of
our deadly enemies, a large dog rushed out, but luckily
without barking; had he done so all was up with us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
being only five to a score, and the hill too steep and
rocky for a gallop. Fortunately he contented himself
with sniffing at the horses' heels, and the ground being
damp and soft we passed noiselessly by, and soon turning
a sharp angle in the road were out of sight. By
seven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> we arrived in Colonel Napier's camp in the
Blinkwater.</p>

<p>On our return two days after, we had some difficulty
in getting up the Pass from the extreme slipperiness of
the road after a heavy rain; and when we gained the
top the clouds hung round us so dense that we could
not see twenty yards in any direction, which was however
all in favour of my solitary ride for the next ten
miles, as just at this point the Mail Escort turned off
for Colonel Buller's camp.</p>

<p>For the next fortnight, when not patrolling, we went
out buck shooting on the open hills, which abounded
with oribee and rheebok; or rode over to the Rifle
Brigade camp, dining with them in the snug little cottages
they had built of wattle and daub, neatly thatched
over, and fitted with doors; the windows made of calico,
and the interiors furnished with rough tables and chairs
of camp manufacture.</p>

<p>On the 14th, I started with a few mounted Boers, for
the Blinkwater, <i>en route</i> to Graham's Town; and at
Beaufort learned the news of an attack at the notorious
Koonap Hill, on a party of Sappers and Miners, escorting
Minié Rifles and ammunition from Graham's Town
up to the troops on the Frontier. Seven of the men had
been killed, and several wounded. The greatest excitement
prevailed in the town.</p>

<p>Twelve miles further, at Lieuw Fontein, where the post-riders
rest two or three hours, was a party of Fingoes on
their way to the scene of the above attack, to follow up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the spoor; and preferring to take my horse, which I had
ridden throughout, at their more leisurely pace, marched
with them all night, reaching the Koonap Hill at daybreak.
We had the greatest difficulty in getting our
frightened horses past the fatal spot. The scarped road
was obstructed with dead horses, oxen, and mules, shot
in the conflict. Two waggons had been turned over, and
the bodies of a couple of Hottentots lay dead in the
middle of the path, which was covered with pools of
blood; and for half a mile further, strewn with torn
uniform, blood-stained linen, flour, coffee, sugar, and
commissariat supplies.</p>

<p>At Fort Brown, whither the dead and wounded had
been conveyed, we found a fatigue party digging graves
for those who had fallen. The waggons which had been
brought off, riddled with balls, stood in the square.
From Captain Moody, R.E., the officer commanding the
party at the time of the attack, I had a full account of
the affair. It appeared that when nearly half way
up the Hill, a volley was suddenly fired on the escort,
from the bush on the lower side, into the advance
guard, killing four of them at once. The attack then
became general, the Sappers fighting gallantly under
their Captain, making a fresh stand as they were driven
from waggon to waggon, till overpowered by numbers,
and having seven killed and nine wounded out of thirty,
they were forced to retreat to an empty house near the
ruins of the old Koonap Post. There they barricaded
themselves, and remained for about an hour, when relief
arrived from Fort Brown, where the sound of the firing
had given the alarm to the garrison.</p>

<p>On their arrival the whole party returned to the scene
of disaster, and scoured through the bush on both sides
the road, but the rebels had decamped with all they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
could carry off, including ammunition and Minié Rifles,
which, however, had fortunately been rendered useless by
the precaution of removing the nipples. Among the
badly wounded was the wife of one of the soldiers who
had been killed; she died during the night at the
ruins, leaving three orphan children behind her, for
whom a subscription was got up on the spot by the
officers at the Fort. Many of the enemy, who were
principally rebel Hottentots, had been killed in the
skirmish.</p>

<p>After a long, hot, and dusty canter with the post-riders,
through the Ecca valley, I off-saddled, by a train of
waggons outspanned on the green flats of Botha's Hill,
to give my horse a roll, as he had now carried me nearly
ninety miles, with only a short time for baiting at three
places. The moment a Cape horse is off-saddled he rolls
himself on the ground,&mdash;mud, rock, sand, or grass all
alike; kicks up his heels in the air, rubs his neck and
face on the earth, more like a dog than a horse; and
after a shake is ready for the road again, and as fresh as
if he had had a feed of corn. Whilst my steed thus enjoyed
himself and nibbled the short burnt up grass, I
squatted under the friendly shade of a waggon, joining
a hospitable old Boer at his meal of <i>biltong</i> and brown
bread, and then jogged leisurely along for the next six
miles over the open plain to Graham's Town.</p>

<p>After the quiet and solitude of Post Retief, the streets
and stores of the town looked wonderfully gay and bustling.
An amusing scene occurred at the hotel, where a
large party of officers, whom various duties had called
in from the field, were dining together. Among the
party was a civilian, a Mr. C&mdash;r, just out from England
as a volunteer, who, it appeared, had accompanied Captain
Moody's ill-fated escort, with the intention of seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
service on the Frontier. In the attack at the Koonap
Hill, he had escaped through the bush, and wisely
secreted himself in the chimney of the deserted house,
but notwithstanding this judicious precaution, narrowly
escaped being shot as a Kaffir, when, begrimed with soot,
he ventured down from his hiding-place, on the arrival
of the detachment from Fort Brown.</p>

<p>This story, humorously related by Major H&mdash;&mdash;, with
sundry embellishments, in happy ignorance that the
hero of the tale was one of the audience, in fact his <i>vis-à-vis</i>,
convulsed the whole table with laughter, which
he naturally attributed to his own facetiousness; when,
on winding up with an announcement that "the gallant
volunteer had returned to Graham's Town, having had
enough of it," the identical individual announced himself,
sending us into a perfect roar at the sudden change
in the face of the Major, who, however, quietly requested
that he might not be called out, as he should
infallibly take to the flue.</p>

<p>While here, I rode out with a party of officers of the
Garrison to visit my brother, who was with a small detachment
of the regiment at Niemand's Kraal, a deserted
farm, nine miles off. The house, which was little more
than a shell, stood alone in a hot sandy little valley, surrounded
by bush-covered hills, abounding in game of all
kinds. Half a dozen tents were pitched round the walls,
which had been loop-holed for musketry. The lower rooms,
the windows barricaded with stones, were occupied by
the men, and the two upper ones by the officers; the
rough walls hung with arms and accoutrements. We
luncheoned on wild boar steaks, and returned to Graham's
Town.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards Graham's Town was enlivened
by a novel reinforcement for the Frontier. Mr. Lakeman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a gentleman whose love of military enterprise had
carried him through the Hungarian and Algerian wars;
and who had just brought out from England, at his own
expense, Minié Rifles, clothing and accoutrements for
250 men, arrived with such volunteers as he had been
able to raise in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. They
were a most extraordinary contingent; all equipped in
leathern helmets, and with "crackers" and frock-coats
of the same stuff; many of them dare-devil fellows ready
for anything, and all admirably cut out for bush work.</p>

<p>A cavalry escort was leaving with two mule waggons,
conveying specie to the Frontier for the payment of the
troops, so I took advantage of the opportunity to return
with them, as did several others&mdash;Major Somerset,
Captain Dundas, Assistant-Commissary-General Sale,
Lady A. Russell (on her way to join her husband at
Beaufort), and Mrs. Sale. At the entrance of the Ecca
valley we met a company of the 74th, sent to cover our
passage. When we had got half-way through, and near
the most dangerous part of the road, the axle tree of the
ladies' waggon broke down, from the jolting and bumping
over the rocks, so that we were obliged to abandon it.
The contents were with difficulty packed in the remaining
waggons, already well filled, and consequently the
ladies were obliged to walk under a hot burning sun;
the dust, which was several inches deep, rising in stifling
clouds at every step; but they trudged on with the
greatest spirit, and at night, outside the walls of Fort
Brown, roughed it in a little wattle and daub cottage,
mud-floored, and with holes in the thatch big enough to
enable them to see how night rolled on in the heavens, and
to hear more plainly the serenading of the jackals and
hyænas.</p>

<p>As we approached the scene of the late attack on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Koonap hill, the mules became so alarmed and restive,
that they could not be got past the place till the dead
horses and oxen had been removed, and thrown down
the ravine; and even then it was not without the
greatest difficulty that both they and many of the
horses, which trembled and snorted violently, were induced
to go forward.</p>

<p>It may be as well to mention here that a great part
of the lost Minié rifles and ammunition were recaptured
by Maj.-Gen. Yorke a few days after the attack on the
waggons, and others subsequently by Colonel Napier,
and though the latter were fitted with nipples, made by a
deserter from the Cape Corps, they had been of little or
no service to the Rebels, for, not understanding conical
bullets, they had put them into the barrel point downwards,
as made up in the cartridge, the natural consequence
of which was that they did not carry more than
half the range of an old musket.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 25th, after a journey such as
few of the gentler sex would attempt, the ladies arrived
in safety at Fort Beaufort, and by the evening following,
I was once more ensconced in our solitary little fort in
the mountains.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
SIXTH ATTACK ON THE WATERKLOOF&mdash;UITHAALDER&mdash;RETURN OF
EXPEDITION AGAINST KRELI.</h2>


<p>The change of Governors did not long suspend the
active operations of warfare; General Cathcart sparing
no pains in thoroughly informing himself of whatever
was necessary to be known, and having personally
reconnoitred the Waterkloof and the Amatolas, was fully
prepared by the beginning of July to carry war once
more into the heart of the former stronghold, in the
interminable fastnesses of which, after twelve months
operations, Macomo (or, as one of our orderly Serjeants
once spelt his name, "Mc,Como") was still lurking, and
now gathering a daily increasing body of his tribe around
him.</p>

<p>A "Confidential Order" appeared on the 6th of July,
commanding the assembly, and arranging the disposition
of three main Columns, under Colonel Buller, Lieut.-Col.
Napier, and Lieut.-Col. Nesbitt, respectively.</p>

<p>Bruce, with fifty mounted men, had orders to lie in
ambush at Mundell's Krantz, on the northern heights,
above the entrance of the valley, to cut off cattle and
fugitives.</p>

<p>As it was necessary to gain our position unseen, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
started full two hours before daybreak, and after a ride
of twelve miles in the dark across the mountains, in a
heavy storm of sleet, which a bitter cold wind drove right
in our teeth, we dismounted, just as the friendly shades
of night were beginning to fail us, at the edge of the
little wood where we were to lie concealed; after some
fumbling with our benumbed fingers, we removed the
saddles and bridles, and picketted our horses to the
trees. The rain cleared off, and as the sun rose, numbers
of beautiful green and crimson touracos began chattering
and screaming among the trees, flitting from branch to
branch, quite close to us, as if aware that we dared not
fire at them. Only one small fire was allowed for all
our coffee kettles, and to prevent even that discovering
our presence, a Boer stood over it dispersing the smoke
with his hat.</p>

<p>We were not more than a mile distant from a large
Kaffir village, and from the edge of our cover could distinctly
see the inhabitants moving rapidly about at the
first boom of artillery, the men arming themselves, and
running at the top of their speed for the points of attack.
Two came to within 500 yards of us to catch a couple of
horses, which we had not seen before; but wishing to
lie <i>perdu</i>, so as to have the chance of a prize, we did
not fire, but watched them mount and race back to the
village to prepare for the fight.</p>

<p>As the fire of Napier's artillery became more continuous,
and the troops appeared on the heights on the
opposite side of the valley, the women of the village
collected in a knot watching them. As we looked through
our glasses, they sat down in a large ring, under the shade
of a spreading tree, and we could distinctly see them
smoking and gesticulating; some perfectly naked, their
sleek ebony skins shining in the sun, but the most part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
in black karosses, giving to the group a very Satanic
appearance. Several came down to a spring, so near
that we could hear them talking. It was a novel and
amusing sight to look in upon a village of savages, and
watch their habits unobserved.</p>

<p>Colonel Buller's column, easily recognised by the
dark body of Rifles contrasting with the red coats, was
seen moving along the southern heights of the Waterkloof
and Kromme, and joining that of his Excellency
the Commander-in-Chief, who had ascended the mountain
from the other side, with Colonel Nesbitt's column.
The two then proceeded to the neck of the forest
separating the Waterkloof from Fullers Hoek, and
after throwing rockets into it, the First and Third
Columns bivouacked for the night at the head of the
Pass, having been fourteen successive hours on the
march. Hardly anything could be more picturesque
than our party in the little wood, the sun streaming
down through trees completely covered with long drooping
bunches of lichen, horses picketted round their hoary
trunks; bridles and accoutrements hanging on the lower
branches, and groups of men lying in the open glade,
or crouched among the outer thickets, peering at the
savages, or eagerly watching for cattle, which, however,
never came.</p>

<p>In the evening Colonel Napier's Division passed close
to our hiding place: the advance guard of mounted
Fingoes, with their usual zeal, firing a volley into us, as
we somewhat incautiously advanced to the edge of the
thicket to look at our friends. We all fell flat on our faces,
or jumped behind the trees; the fat Boers, in their short
round jackets, lying screaming on the ground in an
agony of apprehension. "<i>Yij musst niet skiet! Yij
musst niet skiet! Allamachtig! Verdamte skellums,
warrum skiet yij?</i>" Several had very narrow escapes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
being spattered with mud by the balls; which struck the
ground close to them. The Column halting not more
than a quarter of a mile from us, and concealment being
no longer necessary, B&mdash;&mdash; and I rode over to their
camp, which was on the old ground of October, nine
months before. The picketting pins and old kraals were
still there, as also the blackened circles of the fires
round which many a comrade had sat, now dead and
gone. The graves of poor Norris and of our gallant
fellows were undisturbed, and the grass waved luxuriantly
over them.</p>

<p>We joined our hospitable friends of the 91st at their
soup and grog; and at tattoo rode back to our bivouac,
in considerable fear of being shot by our own sentries
as we approached. Pushing our way through the dark
shadowy thickets towards the illuminated centre, we
stood in a sylvan Robin Hood scene, bright fires blazed
in every direction in the warm-looking wood, lighting
up the grey branches that met overhead, and contrasting
beautifully with the cold clear moonlight that silvered
the tree tops, through which appeared glimpses of the
starry sky. The horses, with drooping heads, stood
sleeping in the ruddy light; the swarthy bearded Boers,
in their red woolen nightcaps, and our men in their
blankets, sat smoking together by the fires.</p>

<p>Soon after we had lain down to sleep by the fire,
rolled in our plaids, a moaning wind rushed through the
trees; the moonlight vanished; a few heavy drops came
pattering on the leaves; and presently the rain poured
steadily down upon us. We slept however, for some
hours, till thoroughly awakened by the cold, and by the
wet which trickled down our necks, we got up one
after another, from the soaked ground. Drawing my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
drenched plaid over my shoulders, for my horse had the
benefit of the blanket, I sat, for the rest of the night,
by the fire, in the steaming circle of soldiers, smoking
my pipe and watching the big drops that fell hissing on
the glowing logs as the fitful gusts sent them rattling
down from the trees. At daylight I mounted my
shivering horse, and with a well soaked saddle under
me, and as stiff as a poker from the wet and cold, rode
over to Colonel Napier for orders. The Column was
just falling in for the march, and I was to remain with
fifteen men, in ambuscade for the Kaffirs who might
come, as was their constant practice, to search the
deserted encampment. We entered the little belt of
wood, within pistol shot of the fires, and the Division
moved off. Soon after its last section had disappeared
over the furthest ridge, the ground was covered with
enormous vultures, boom-vogels, black and white crows,
and secretary birds, which stalked about within a very
few yards of us. The boom-vogel is a very dark-plumaged
vulture, like a turkey cock, with red wattles and a bare
brown neck; they go in pairs only, and generally accompany
a flock of the common vulture.</p>

<p>After two or three hours useless watching in a wet
ditch, in wetter clothes, and on a bitter cold day, our
zeal began to evaporate; and as the Kaffirs did not
appear, and a look-out, whom I had sent to the top of
the highest tree, reported nothing moving on the plain
as far as he could see, we came out of our hiding-place;
the birds, very much astonished at our appearance, took
themselves off, and we marched back by a little hollow
to our comrades in the wood.</p>

<p>Two hours afterwards, Colonel Napier's column appeared
on the plain before us, the 91st in advance,
skirmishing with a few straggling Kaffirs, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
artillery firing shell into the valley below. From our
position we could see numbers of Kaffirs along a rising
ground above the troops, out of their sight, firing on
them and running from rock to rock, playing at hide
and seek. It was altogether a very pretty sight, and we
could not but admire the wonderful quickness and
cunning of these savage sharpshooters. Observing some
of them making for the krantz, as they were driven
before the advancing troops, we galloped off to intercept
them. The column having turned off and encamped on
the ground of the former evening, B&mdash;&mdash; went down
to see Colonel Napier, leaving me with the men on the
hill. In a few minutes afterwards a small body of
Kaffirs appeared below us driving a herd of cattle, at
which we commenced firing at long rifle-range, causing
such commotion among them that they broke away in
all directions, several evidently hit, making directly for
us, followed by about a dozen Kaffirs. A few of the
Burghers, thinking to secure them, descended the steep
face of the hill, but had not gone far on the flat below,
when hundreds of Kaffirs came rushing in from all
sides, and taking a little hollow unseen by the Burghers,
tried to surround and cut them off. Calling all my men
together, we opened such a steady and well directed fire
on them, that they were temporarily checked, and two
of them being shot dead by "the Minié Riflemen," and
several wounded, they turned back again, and our too
venturesome allies, made fully aware of their peril,
quickly reascended the hill.</p>

<p>Another night of rain succeeded, with sleet and snow,
and a cold searching wind, doubly severe by contrast
with the intense heat of the day. When we woke in
the morning, the mountain ranges, as far as the eye could
reach, were white with snow. The sleet turned to rain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and the wind, piercing through our wet clothes, was so
intensely chilling, that the men who had, in fact, been
lying in puddles all night, were nearly helpless. At eight
o'clock a welcome reprieve arrived, a party of Cape Corps
from the General's column, bringing us orders to return
to our quarters, which we did right willingly, and after a
cold dreary ride of eighteen miles, reached Post Retief.
The only casualties during the three days' operations
were one man killed and one mortally wounded.</p>

<p>The operations on the Waterkloof, the object of which
was, by continued annoyance, to drive the skulking Kaffirs
out of their hiding places, were only suspended for a day
or two. On the 14th we were once more patrolling our
mountain ridges; the troops had again assembled at the
head of the kloof, and his Excellency the Governor-General
arriving with his Staff, a site was selected by the Officers
of the Engineers for a permanent defensible camp and
two stone redoubts at the Horseshoe, completely commanding
Hermanus' Kloof, the head of the Waterkloof,
and the communication between it and Fullers Hoek, as
also the Kromme, and the approach from the west, and,
by a mule path in direct communication with the Blinkwater
camp below. Being situated on Mount Misery,
and within a few hundred yards of the spot where our
gallant Colonel fell, the name of Fort Fordyce was
given to it.</p>

<p>His Excellency had already built several stone towers
in different parts of the Amatola and Keiskamma districts,
for the double purpose of serving as present
garrisons, and becoming nuclei and defences for future
villages; and their utility and value every succeeding
day proved more strongly. This part of the Waterkloof
being thus occupied permanently, our operations would
have to be directed against the lower and less intricate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
parts of the valley, into which the enemy were now
driven, and as a commencement, Colonel Buller with
the Rifle Brigade and 60th Rifles attacked, and completely
destroyed, on the 24th, the village at Mundell's
Krantz purposely left for this surprise; killing many of
the enemy, and taking some of their arms and ammunition,
with a few cattle and horses. His only casualties
were three men wounded, who were brought the following
day, by a detachment of the Rifle Brigade, under
Curzon, to Post Retief, which now wore the appearance
of a large military hospital; the barrack square, on a fine
summer evening, presenting men with bandaged heads,
arms in slings, or hobbling on crutches, and two poor
fellows each minus a leg.</p>

<p>The old routine, to which we had again returned,
of patrols and escorts between the Blinkwater camp, or
Mount Misery, where the new redoubts were now building,
was broken in upon, by the arrival of 200 mounted
Fingo Levies on a roving patrol, under Captain Campbell,
who, a few miles off, had fallen in with, and killed a
party of seven rebel Totties. From some women who
were with them, he had learned that another party in advance,
had gone on to the village at Mundell's Krantz,
not being aware of its destruction, and that they would
probably remain there all night. An attack was therefore
determined on with our united forces, as soon as it
was dark. But just after sunset, as we were getting our
dinner, the Kaffirs came down on us instead, and swept
off eighty head of commissariat cattle, which the herdsmen,
with their usual incorrigible carelessness, had suffered to
be out too late, and too far from the Post. Every one
disappeared in a moment to order his horse, and get his
arms. The bugle sounded the "alarm" and "assembly;"
and in five minutes, some 300 men had left the gates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
which were shut and barred behind us. The infantry
took a short cut up the mountain, in rear of the Post, over
which the enemy had gone; while two of the mounted
men rode round by Mantatees Hoek, to intercept their
retreat. It was a fine moonlight night, and we went at
a slapping pace the whole way, up hill and down,
clattering along the echoing road. At each cross path
there was a temporary check while the Fingoes in advance
narrowly examined the ground for spoor, and then on
we went again. At the end of six miles, the greater
part of the field having tailed off far behind, we saw a
fire in a hollow of the plain, and pushed rapidly on
towards it, several getting tremendous falls over the large
ant hills which, from their peculiar hue, are not distinguishable
at night. I rode right into a sawpit, near
an old shieling, fortunately without injury; but it was
no easy task to get out again, though I managed to do
so just in time to see the Burghers in front, blazing away
at some dark objects round the fire, which however, being
only stumps and logs, did not return the volley. While
hunting about for spoor, with a burning brand, we
heard voices just over the rise. Thinking the Kaffirs
were now in our hands, we crept cautiously round the
eminence to surprise them, but discovered, just in time to
prevent a mutual volley, that they were some of our own
people. In a few minutes after these blunders, bright
flashes of musketry showed where the infantry were,
high up on the dark ridge of the Little Winterberg,
in rear of which we had now got. The enemy was
between us; and in a very short time, the whole of the
cattle were recaptured, but whether with any loss to the
marauders, the darkness of the night prevented our
ascertaining. The fort was regained at midnight.</p>

<p>The veteran and gallant Commander of our Division,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
General Somerset, being appointed to a command in
India, during this month took leave of us, and of a
country which for thirty years had had the benefit of his
services, and where he had commanded in three wars.
He was greatly beloved and respected by his Division,
and the esteem and regard in which he was held by the
inhabitants were manifested by their inviting him to a
public dinner at Beaufort.</p>

<p>About a week after this, having been left for some
days in almost solitary occupancy of the Post, Bruce returned
with his escort of mounted men and Burghers
from Beaufort, bringing an order from the General for
my appointment to head-quarters. Three days afterwards,
I was quartered in Fort Beaufort. The change
of temperature from the mountains to the dusty town,
shimmering and dancing in the burning sun, was most
disagreeable. Hot north winds from the deserts constantly
prevailed, almost stifling the breath, and scorching
the face like the blast from a furnace; doors, windows,
and furniture cracked with the heat, and the
thermometer often rose twenty or thirty degrees in a few
hours.</p>

<p>Each morning, the streets were filled with endless
droves of cattle and goats going to pasture; and strings of
Fingo women with children tied on their backs, and
large hoes over their shoulders, trudging to their "meelie
gardens." All day long, crowds of dirty, drunken Totties
of both sexes, hung round the doors of the canteens;
fought, shrieked, and swore in the square; or sat in the
sun smoking, picking each other's heads, and eating snuff.
Naked Fingoes trotted about on oxen, and little black
urchins charged through the streets on calves; while
dusty post-riders and mounted patrols galloped in with
reeking horses; and native escorts straggled out guarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
long trains of wagons. Towards evening, the cattle
returned in hundreds; and the Fingo women re-entered
the town, carrying on their heads enormous pumpkins,
huge bundles of firewood, or grass. At sundown,
the bugles and trumpets of the different barracks
sounded "the retreat;" at dark, the cicada began his
night-long ringing chirp, and, softened by the distance,
the Fingoe's wild chant and monotonous drumming
continued without intermission till long past midnight.</p>

<p>The Governor-General, whose residence and head-quarters
were at Fort Beaufort, had just left with a
strong escort for the Umvani, about five and thirty miles
from Kreli's "Great Place," where he had summoned
an assembly of troops and burghers to meet him on the
6th instant, to proceed against that Chief, who had not
only refused to send in the fine of cattle imposed on him
by Sir H. Smith, on the faith of his promise to pay
which the troops had been withdrawn, but had insolently
sent back the letter in which his Excellency
General Cathcart demanded payment, and remonstrated
with him on his want of good faith.</p>

<p>One morning not long after arriving at Beaufort, the
Colonel commanding the Division sent to desire me to see
him immediately. A body of Kaffirs had entered the
colony at a point about fifteen miles off; and in half an
hour, I was marching out of the town with about 200
men, a company of the Rifle Brigade, another of the
74th, and some Fingo Levies, to cut off the enemy's
return. A march of seventeen miles, brought us an hour
after dark to the ruins of Post Victoria, an isolated fort,
abandoned in 1845, and afterwards burnt by the Kaffirs.
We had but just lighted our bivouac fires within the
square formed by the broken walls, when, to our great
surprise, for we were in an uninhabited district, miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
from house or camp, we heard a bugle at a short distance
sound the "cease firing." We could only imagine it a ruse
of the Rebels, who in skirmishing had latterly adopted
our bugle sounds, retiring, advancing, firing, and changing
direction, by the bugle-calls used in our service. But it
turned out to be a patrol of the 2nd Queen's, from Fort
Hare, on the same spoor as ourselves. We were now a
party of five officers, and 350 men.</p>

<p>As the two main "Kaffir-paths" entered the colony
about half a mile distant on each side the Post, I
placed "forelaying parties" on them for the night, but
they came in at daylight, without having seen anything,
and the detachment of the Queen's marched for Fort
Willshire, another deserted post. Having despatched
all the mounted Fingoes to Foonah's Kloof to reconnoitre,
I went with a party of infantry in an opposite
direction, to see if we could strike on any spoor to guide
us in our movements.</p>

<p>For miles the country stretched away in bush-sprinkled
wavy downs, dancing in the heat, and still as death.
The only living thing we saw, though the country was
said to abound in game, was a solitary honey-bird,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that
flew before us from bush to bush, returning at intervals,
and calling us on in the most unmistakable manner,
till it stopped at an old tree, where the Fingoes found a
bee's nest in a hollow branch. Leaving the bird as
much as he could manage, they brought away the rest,
which they ate, comb and all.</p>

<p>In a little belt of wood, clothing a deep dell, the
dry course of the Shishago, we came on the spoor of
koodoo, boschbok, and guinea-fowl, and presently on
that of a few Kaffirs and cattle, quite recent, which had
a most refreshing effect on us; everybody brightened up,
and the Fingoes were like new men, intently following
up the faintest marks with their wonderful instinctive
quickness. A few head of cattle were captured, but
nothing was seen of the Kaffirs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<p>At night we again waylaid "the paths" without success,
and next day marched through a bushy country to
a ruined farm, ten miles off, commanding another
favourite Kaffir path. Nothing could be more beautiful
than this spot. In the centre of an open grassy glade,
surrounded by wooded hills, lay a fine clear lake,
formed by ledges of rock running across the Kat River,
which poured over in a hundred cooling cascades, where
the men revelled in the luxury of a bath after their hot
march. The overhanging trees, and tall reedy fringe of
the graceful papyrus, were filled with <i>suiker vogels</i>, or
"sugar birds,"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of gorgeous colouring, crimson, green,
yellow, and blue, glancing brilliantly in the sun, and
throwing the plumage of the numerous lories quite into
the shade. It was useless to fire at them with two ounce
conical balls; but so anxious was B&mdash;&mdash;n to possess a
specimen, that he left the water, and, without dressing,
followed a pair of them with a handful of stones,
from tree to tree with a perseverance which, in his
state of nudity, was most ludicrous. The fine krantzes of
perpendicular basaltic rock along the river were inhabited
by a colony of large blue-faced baboons, with
pink behinds, which added considerably to the effect of
their comical gestures. Numbers of empty tortoise-shells,
of immense size, lay about among the scattered bush,
which was in great part cactus, euphorbia, geranium,
and thorn. Returning from a stroll after our bathe,
we found our three patrol-tents pitched; pewter platters,
sixpenny knives and forks, and tin-tots laid out on a
tarpaulin on the greensward; and a large frying-pan
full of ration beef frizzling over a fire inclosed by a
semicircular kraal of thick bushes. The Kaffir path,
far enough out of sight of our bivouac, was again <i>forelaid</i>
for the night; and at 12 o'clock we went, under
the guidance of a Fingo, with a handful of men to reconnoitre,
and if possible surprise a favourite hiding-place
of the Kaffirs among the cliffs; but, after stealthily
climbing step by step up the rocks, with fingers on
the trigger, found the retreat tenantless! The forelaying-party
was relieved at daylight, without "anything
extra," as the sergeants said, having occurred.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p>We afterwards learned that the Kaffirs had left the
colony by a different track, but only to fall in with another
ambuscade, which retook the spoil, and shot one or two
of the plunderers. A long and hot march, passing
through Barooka, a deserted Fingo village, brought us
at mid-day to Birt's station, a deserted missionary settlement,
where, from the excessive heat of the sun, we
halted for a couple of hours, spreading plaids and blankets
over the orange trees and large American aloes, for shelter
from its rays. From thence our way lay through a solitary
bushy country to Fort Beaufort, which we
reached late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Next day I was sent with a strong party to escort a
waggon load of Minié rifles and ammunition to Fort
Hare, twelve miles off. While there, a patrol of the
2nd Queen's, which had been sent to the Chumie Mountain,
to cover the descent of the returning Kei expedition,
unexpectedly came in, having been surrounded by
the enemy and compelled to retreat. A stronger force
was immediately ordered out, and my party pressed into
the service. We sat down at midnight in high spirits to
a hasty supper, having a march of fifteen miles to accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
before daylight. The night was fine and starlight,
and we trudged cheerily along the hard road,
through a thick bush, the air scented with mimosa and
jessamine.</p>

<p>At daybreak we were on an open green plain at the
foot of the beautiful Chumie Mountain, whose grey
timber-sprinkled crags and extensive forests excited the
most lively expressions of admiration, as the rising sun
beamed out upon them. We encamped at nine o'clock
on the smooth green flats at the head of the Chumie
Hoek, a lovely valley, surrounded on three sides by
mountains clothed with verdure to the tops, and partially
wooded.</p>

<p>Close to our bivouac were the burnt ruins of Auckland,
one of the military villages destroyed by the
enemy at the outbreak of the war. The silent, deserted
street, down which a jackal skulked at our approach,
was strewed with the bones of the massacred
inhabitants.</p>

<p>We had scarcely formed our bivouac, when parties of
Kaffirs and Rebels began to show themselves on all sides
of our position; some crowning the heights above us,
and others emerging from the lower edge of the bush at
the foot of the mountains. A sharp skirmish took place
with a few of the latter, who were driven back to their
holds.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, parties of mounted Kaffirs were
observed moving in our direction along the higher ridges
of the Amatola chain; and a strong body of Rebels,
marching in file, with "sloped arms" came in sight, following
a well-mounted commander, who was attended by a
mounted staff and a bugler! Taking up a strong position,
high above us, looking right down into our camp,
they halted and piled arms with the regularity of troops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Presently a white flag was sent to us half way down the
mountain, with four or five unarmed Totties, to whom
Lieut.-Col. Burns sent the garrison Adjutant and an interpreter,
to see what they wanted. We watched the two
approaching parties till they met. After a few minutes
conversation, the interpreter was seen galloping back to
the camp. He was the bearer of a request that the commanding
officer would call in one or two mounted men
of our party, who were too near the flag of truce, as
"General Uithaalder wished to come down himself to
speak to the officer, but was afraid of treachery." They
were called in by the bugle, and we soon saw "<i>the
General</i>" descending from the heights, followed by his Staff
unarmed. We could distinctly see through our glasses
each part of their dress and accoutrements. Uithaalder
wore the braided surtout of a British staff-officer,
with the red stripe down the trowsers, a red morocco
and gold sword belt, a cavalry sword, and a straw hat,
with black crape round it. His horse was held by an
attendant a little in rear, and his Secretary was seen
busy writing in a little note book. They were presently
joined by several Totties, wearing the red coats of the unfortunate
Sappers killed on the Koonap Hill; all in camp
were burning to attack them, but our commander refused
to do so, his orders being simply to encamp at the foot
of the mountain to cover the descent of the expedition
returning from the Kei. The conference broke up.
Uithaalder and his attendants slowly ascended the mountain
side, and his force moved off in a northerly direction
along the ridge. The officer and interpreter
returned to the bivouac. The Rebel Leader's object was
to express his anxiety to come to terms, his weariness of
the war, and his wish to know again on what conditions
the Governor-General would make peace. He further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
announced his intention of sending a letter the following
morning for his Excellency.</p>

<p>Having come out from Beaufort totally unprovided for
the bivouac, my men had to sleep on the bare ground
without a blanket to cover them. I was fortunate
enough to get the loan of a horse-rug for the night, and
hitting on a comfortable hollow for my hip (an indispensable
requisite for a good night's rest on the ground),
was soon sound asleep on the open plain.</p>

<p>It was not yet quite daylight, when all were suddenly
roused by the hoarse cry of "Guard, turn out!" followed
by "Fall in," "Stand to your arms." We were up and
armed in an instant, and stood in companies on our
respective faces of the encampment, and a large moving
body of black figures in blankets, and armed with
assegais, was indistinctly seen approaching; just as the
sentry, who had thrice challenged them without any reply,
was about to fire a shot across their bows to bring them
to, they yelled out, "Amafingo! Amafingo!" They were
the Fingo Levies of the returning Kei expedition; the
wildest looking host that can be imagined, their woolly
heads covered with ostrich feathers gathered on their
route, and their scanty dress fluttering in rags. They
poured into our camp with their usual boisterous hilarity,
greeting officers and men alike, with a friendly "Morrow,
Johnnie!"</p>

<p>The Governor-General and the regular troops had
taken a route down the other side of the mountain, and
we turned our faces towards Fort Hare, where he was
supposed already to have arrived. We had not gone
more than a quarter of a mile, when a bugle sounded
the "halt" far up on the hills, and we perceived the
white flag and two or three figures rapidly descending
the mountain; bringing the promised letter. As two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of our party went to receive it, the enemy's bugle above,
sounded the "right incline," and keeping away in that
direction, they avoided thereby, as we afterwards learned,
a deep sluit, of which they were thus politely made
aware. No force was to be seen to day. The purport
of the letter, which was very well written in English,
was to propose terms of peace without surrendering their
leaders. His Excellency took no notice whatever of the
proposal, and not only expressed his displeasure at the
conference having taken place at all, but offered a reward
of five hundred pounds for Uithaalder, dead or alive.</p>

<p>On approaching Fort Hare we were met by Lieutenant
Lord Charles Hay, 2nd Queen's, one of the officers just
returned with the Governor-General, and from him we
learned that Kreli's "Great Place" had been burned to
the ground; nearly 10,000 head of cattle, upwards of
100 horses, and 1000 goats, captured, and a great number
of Kaffirs killed; a punishment the Chief would not
soon forget, as the fine he had refused to pay was only
1500 head of cattle.</p>

<p>The following day, on our return to Fort Beaufort, by
a lower road, through bush white over with the twining
jessamine, we passed through acres of young locusts, a
sight as extraordinary as that of their flight; the whole
ground being hidden by a moving black mass of little
insects about the size of a common house-fly, giving it
the appearance of a burnt plain; as we moved onward,
the bulk of them cleared away before us with a rustling
sound, yet still so thick did they lie underfoot, that we
crushed them in thousands.</p>

<p>At sunset we approached Beaufort by the smooth
green down, over which innumerable herds of cattle were
winding, whistled on by wild kaross-clad herdsmen, gun
and assegais in hand, and entered the town through the
Fingo Kraals, where swarthy maidens were milking their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
goats, saturæ capellæ; men kraaling their cattle for
the night, and women of all ages&mdash;young and graceful,
old and haggard, skeletons or shaking masses of fat, constantly
arriving, with huge bundles of firewood balanced
on their heads.</p>

<p>Several of the soldiers who had been wounded in
the late operations, died during the hot weather, in
hospital; as often as we accompanied their remains to
the beautiful burying ground on the green flats outside
the town, with the impressive accompaniments of a
military funeral, the alternating strains of the "Dead
March," and the wailing lament of the Pipes, it was impossible
not to feel something unusually touching in the
death of a brave man laid to his last rest so far from
home and friends.</p>

<p>On these occasions, we invariably observed, while the
crowd of Fingoes behaved with decorum and feeling, that
the Totties, as we passed, displayed a malicious and
gratified expression; indeed, we had it on good authority,
that more than once, men and women had indulged in
dancing and open rejoicing because another of the "roed
batjes" (red jackets) had gone to his grave.</p>

<p>The head-quarter Division of the Kei expedition
entered the town. The large square was filled with a
host of ragged soldiers, and the streets were blocked up
by bellowing thousands of cattle, while officers, out at the
elbows, mounted on half starved horses; Fingoes driving
oxen laden with dagha; and camp followers leading pack-horses
covered with blankets, raw meat, and jingling
kettles, worked their way through the moving mass. All
was din and confusion, for the Fingoes would not go to
their kraals, and the cattle had none to go to. They
were afterwards sold by public auction in the centre of
the town, and the proceeds divided among those who had
formed the expedition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
FINAL ATTACK, AND CLEARANCE OF THE WATERKLOOF.</h2>


<p>On the afternoon of Sunday the 12th of September, as
we were leaving church, the 73rd regiment, from King
Williams' Town, under Colonel Eyre, marched through
the town on their way to join the force assembling for a
grand and final attack on the Waterkloof. They encamped
on the other side the river, on the Blinkwater road;
though absolutely in rags, patched with every description
and colour of cloth and leather, many a shirt tail dangling
from under the lappels of their coats, they looked
most soldier-like, and marched with the greatest regularity,
the Rifle Brigade band playing them through the
streets.</p>

<p>The following day a detachment of the 74th being ordered
to reinforce Colonel Eyre's column, I unexpectedly found
myself in orders to join him at day-break next morning,
delighted, after having shared in all the former attacks,
to be in at the last. At four in the morning of the 14th we
left the barrack square by starlight, and marching through
the sleeping town, halted outside the line of Colonel Eyre's
camp-fires as day was breaking. The troops were already
accoutred, and the tents struck, and in a few minutes we
were advancing through the open bush along the foot of
the Kromme to the Yellow-Wood River, where we remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
two hours for breakfast. On one or two of the
grassy ridges overtopping the forest on the mountain
side mounted Kaffirs now and then showed themselves,
watching our movements.</p>

<p>Three or four miles further on, we halted and
bivouacked at the ruins of Nieland's farm, at the foot of
the Pass where the severe engagement, under Colonel
Fordyce, had taken place a year before.</p>

<p>The remaining three columns of attack, under Lieut.-Col.
Napier, Lieut.-Col. Nesbitt, and Major Horsford, the
two former under general command of Colonel Buller,
on the north side of the Waterkloof, the latter at the extremity
of the valley, were to move simultaneously at
dawn next day in co-operation.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark, when, at four in the morning, we
groped our way out of camp, the waggons and tents being
left with a small guard under charge of an officer, and
ascended a steep Pass which we had not visited since the
severe struggle on the 9th September. As it became
light, a few skulls and scattered bones were to be seen
at the top of the path, though we must have passed
many more lower down, where the fight had been hottest.
After a stiff climb, halting frequently to breathe
the men, who coughed violently, an oft remarked
symptom of the telling effects of the hardships and exposures
of the campaign, we reached the mountain
summit, which was enveloped in a thick cold fog. We
moved along the table-land towards the south scarps of
the Waterkloof, the point of our operations, but the
mist was so thick that we halted till the sun had fully
risen, when it partially cleared off, and we observed an
extended column of at least 400 Kaffirs moving along
the narrow ridge connecting the Kromme heights, on
which we were, with the peninsular and otherwise totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
inaccessible Iron Mountain, to take possession of
its towering krantz. Colonel Eyre immediately countermarching
his column, moved us rapidly forward to the
attack of the Iron Mountain, and we entered a little
forest path leading along the connecting ridge, and
so narrow that it barely afforded room for two abreast,
continually obstructing the whole column for some
minutes. After an hour's gradual ascent without opposition,
we crowned the height, when the enemy,
firing half a dozen shots, the balls whistling harmlessly
over our heads, fled to the bush below, by paths so precipitous
and narrow as to be impracticable for anything
but Kaffirs and baboons, leaving behind them some two
or three women and several horses, which we took. By
this false move on their part, the enemy was placed in
our hands; the Rifle Brigade being in the valley at
the foot of the mountain in front, two parties were instantly
despatched by the Colonel right and left to cut off
escape by either flank. We made our way down by a
path so smooth and steep that only the greatest precaution
prevented a headlong career after the loose
stones that bounded down before us into the deep valley;
the ammunition and pack-horses sliding down on their
hind quarters, and the rocket troop proving very troublesome
from the difficulty of keeping the heavy apparatus
off the horses' necks. The kloofs and forests thus enclosed,
were completely scoured, and though the enemy
by dispersing, and hiding in the thickest parts of the
extensive thorny bushes, succeeded in a great measure in
making their escape, many were killed, seventy-one women
and children captured, secreted among the cavities
of the rocks at the base of the krantz, and quantities
of assegais, guns, and native ornaments taken. Half a
dozen Rebels, Cape Corps deserters, killed in the attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of their stronghold, were hung on the nearest trees, as
examples to any of their comrades who might chance to
come that way.</p>

<p>At the ruins of Brown's farm, in the valley of the
Waterkloof, Major Horsford's column, which had
marched up the valley, joined ours. They had killed a
good many Kaffirs, captured some horses, burnt and destroyed
many huts, and stormed and destroyed a gunsmith's
shop in the rocks, fortified and loop-holed, and
well-stocked with tools and materials for the repair of
fire-arms.</p>

<p>The whole valley was smoking from end to end with
burning huts, as were the heights above us, crowned with
the 60th and 91st, scarcely visible from their distance.</p>

<p>After a two hours' rest the main column moved up
the valley to the head of the Waterkloof, two parties
being detached to our right, one to attack a small body
of Kaffirs collected above us, and commanding our intended
ascent; the other up the south scarps to intercept
the flight of any dislodged parties in that direction.</p>

<p>After a stiff pull up the Pass, we found the 60th
Rifles posted in the bush along the path covering our
ascent, and on the open ground above, several more
companies of that regiment and the 91st, with many
old friends. Crossing the Horseshoe Flat, we entered
the belt of forest dividing it from the Kromme range
beyond, and found the well-remembered path lined by
the 60th Rifles, who, as we passed, presented us with
cigars and brandy-and-water, on the very spot where,
on former occasions, we had been treated by the Kaffir
Rifles to volleys of bullets. A short, but at that advanced
hour, most weary march across the open ground, brought
us, after dark, to our bivouac on a bleak bare ridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
where, from the rocky nature of the ground, we broke
nearly all the pegs of our patrol-tents without eventually
succeeding in pitching them. The following morning,
by daylight, we were on the move, and separating
into four bodies, again scoured the kloofs on the south
side and head of the Waterkloof, and crowned the Iron
Mountain, throwing rockets into the inaccessible retreats,
killing several Kaffirs and burning numerous huts. The
Fingoes skirmished with unusual activity, being in great
awe of the <i>Inkosi Ameshlomani</i> (the Four Eyed Chief),
as both they and the Kaffirs called Colonel Eyre, from
the circumstance of his wearing spectacles, to which
they attributed his great vigilance and sharpness;
whenever they exhibited the slightest hesitation to obey
the order to enter the bush, he rode right at them, laying
his jambok about their shoulders, and drove them
before him into the cover. They did not, however, entertain
the same respect for everybody, for, on another
occasion, when a young Levy officer tried the same
discipline, he was unceremoniously tumbled off his horse
and pitched into a thorn-bush!</p>

<p>At the gorge of the Waterkloof, Colonel Eyre with his
Staff and escort rode on, leaving the Column with me,
with orders to rejoin the main body, four miles up the
Waterkloof valley. We proceeded to the entrenched
field-works just thrown up at Nels, where we halted
at ten, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, for breakfast. The officers' pack-horses
having been sent with one of the other columns, by a
more practicable road, we had nothing to eat, but Captain
Jesse, R.E., commanding the camp there, kindly
brought us a loaf, a cold leg of mutton, and a bottle of
Cape wine, absolute luxuries to fasting men. Thence we
marched up the valley, which at this season, spring, was
as fragrant as beautiful with flowering plants and bushes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the Boer-boon, covered with thick clusters of crimson
blossom, conspicuous above every other. The larger
trees along the rocky stream were alive with monkeys
leaping from bough to bough. We rejoined the column at
Brown's farm, and a party of Fingoes arrived at the same
time with a despatch from the Governor-General, who, on
the heights above, was personally directing the whole of
the movements. We ascended the valley&mdash;a long line
of red-coats, Riflemen, Highlanders, Artillery, Mounted
Irregulars, and Fingoes; the Kaffir prisoners, with the
pack-horses and mules bringing up the rear. At a
point where the valley branches off into two, we took
the south branch, and the Fingoes were sent up the
mountain on our right to scour the bush. They continued
ascending the green slopes, till scarcely visible,
and then entering the forest at the foot of the perpendicular
basaltic rocks, sharp firing at once began;
tracing their progress by the wreaths of smoke that
curled up above the dark trees, we regulated our
movements below by their advance. Heavy firing was
heard in the mean time from the north side of the valley.
After gradually working our way to the top of the kloof,
the Fingoes emerged from the forest, which ended
abruptly at that point, driving before them a score or
two of Kaffir women and children, and a few sore-backed
horses. The women, like those before taken,
had their woolly hair entwined with the claws and teeth
of wild beasts, and wore karosses of hide, finely dressed,
and dyed black with mimosa bark, of which all the
larger trees here had been stripped. The unexpected
meeting of these fresh prisoners with those previously
taken was an affecting sight to witness. All were in
a most wretched state of emaciation and weakness,
having been nearly starved for want of food, and subsisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
entirely on leaves, roots, and berries; their arms
and legs were more like black sticks than human limbs.
Cruel as their capture may appear, it was in reality
a respite from misery and starvation, and moreover was
rendered absolutely necessary, for, in their way, they
were no less enemies to the tranquillity of the country
than the men, acting as sentinels, commissaries, and spies,
bringing food (which they might not touch), ammunition
and information from our very towns and camps,
most materially thwarting our efforts to bring the war
to an end. The Tottie women did not appear to
consider it at all a misfortune to be taken, for being
unaccustomed to a bush life and its precarious means
of subsistence in such times, they preferred a dry bed in
a jail, with prison diet, to liberty and starvation. Our
Fingo allies wished to put the prisoners to death; and
were sulky at not being allowed to carry out their notions
of warfare. A female prisoner, unable to keep
up with the rest, was shot dead by one of these fellows
before we had the least idea of his intention; so instantaneous
was the act that my horse nearly stumbled over
her body as it fell in the path. It required all the exertions
of the officers to prevent further cruelties, nor was
a stop put to them, till several of these half-tamed
savages were knocked down and made prisoners of. One
of the Kaffir women, with a child of a few weeks old on
her back, becoming too exhausted to carry it, deliberately
threw it away; it was, however, picked up by an officer,
and given to a Fingo, with orders to carry it to the
camp; the fellow obeying with a ludicrous mixture of
disgust and nonchalance to the intense amusement of his
comrades. But next morning the infant was missing,
when "Johnny" being questioned as to what he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
done with it, replied with the greatest coolness imaginable,
that it <i>had escaped</i> during the night.</p>

<p>On another occasion, one of them, when sentry over a
Kaffir, was observed giving a knife to his charge, and
making signs to him to cut the rheim which secured his
feet to a gun-wheel; the Kaffir was in doubt for a little,
but reassured by the friendly nods and signs of his
keeper, severed the bands and jumped up, but only to
be shot dead by the sentry, who reported the attempted
escape of the prisoner.</p>

<p>These, and a few other like instances of barbarity
which occurred, hardly any degree of watchfulness could
have entirely prevented. It was also next to impossible,
amongst a set of men always ready to screen a culprit, to
bring home conviction to the real offender; and doubtless,
many more cases of barbarity would have taken
place but for the presence and exertions of the troops.
Yet the Fingoes acted in accordance with the practice of
savage warfare rather than from cruel or vindictive feelings;
and had they and the Kaffirs alone been opposed
one to the other, it is more than probable that every
woman and child taken by either side would have been
put to death.</p>

<p>After climbing the steep rocky hill at the head of the
kloof, the men resting every few yards from exhaustion, we
proceeded some miles further along the range, and again
prepared to bivouac on the top of the mountains, but
had scarcely taken up our ground, when torrents of
rain descended, running into our patrol-tents before
a drain could be dug round them. The men having
only a single blanket, and that of course soaked through,
sat all night by the fires in the storm; a keen searching
wind sweeping over the mountain top, rendered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
night so intensely chilling, that sleep was out of the
question, and at four o'clock when the reveillé sounded,
every one was glad to be moving. The wind and
sleet at this hour were even colder than before, and
though we scorched our clothes on one side at the fires,
the other clung to us like so much ice. At the head of
the Wolfsback Pass we came up to the 60th Rifles
lining the bush. They were half frozen, and envied us
being on the march. The mountain tops all round were
again white with snow, and on the opposite heights we
could see the other Division shelling the deep intervening
kloof, an unbroken forest of great extent; the effect, as
the shells exploded far below our feet, was very fine.
We descended the steep pass in single file, winding
through the narrow forest, and halted at Blakeway's
farm, where we found the sun quite hot. The almond
and peach trees in the deserted garden were covered
with sheets of pink blossom. A party of Cape Corps
had arrived a few minutes before, under Captain Carey,
with 200 sheep which they had captured in the kloof.</p>

<p>In an hour we were again climbing the Kromme
range by another path more to the eastward, and gaining
the ridge, looked down on the other side into Harrys
Kloof, in the bottom of which a small body of the 91st and
Cape Corps were halted; the long narrow ridge separating
it from Fullers Hoek beyond was smoking from end to
end with burning huts. We continued ascending the ridge
up to the heights, two companies below scouring the
forest kloof as we advanced by a wood path so close, that
though we marched single file, the whole column had to
halt every twenty yards till the front could move on, the
bugles sounding the <i>halt</i> and <i>advance</i> from front to rear
by companies. We came to an immense collection
of burnt-out Kaffir fires, and places for sentinels on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
points commanding most extensive prospects of the beautiful
country below. All round where we stood was
thickly covered with pellets of chewed root. In front
there was some firing, and a few Kaffirs were killed,
who lay in the thickets as we came up. In one part of
the shady path, we came suddenly on the corpse of a
rebel deserter hanging from a tree; the blood trickling
from a bullet hole in his forehead ran down his
face and dropped on his toes.</p>

<p>No sooner had we toiled to the heights, where a
detachment of the 60th Rifles was covering our movements,
than we again descended by another more difficult
and more precipitous path, down which men and
horses slid twenty or thirty yards at once into Harrys
Kloof, which was penetrated, and crossed in five different
directions.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the descent we set fire to a very
large village of Kaffir huts, and captured some horses.
Part of the column being sent up the kloof by a path
on the right, the rest of us, under Colonel Eyre,
passed through the smouldering village, its heat almost
overpowering, and penetrated to the head of the kloof,
which was one dense, dark, and tangled forest up to the
heights on which the tiny figures of the 60th were barely
visible against the bright sky. The whole column
worked through it in every direction, guided by constant
bugling; the company and regimental calls of the different
corps, with "advance," "retire," "right and left incline,"
&amp;c.,&mdash;being all issued by Colonel Eyre, who, with a bugler
of each regiment at his side, thus conducted in the most
splendid style the movement of upwards of a thousand
men in different bodies, unseen, through an extensive
mountain forest. A few head of cattle and some horses
were taken, and some of the enemy killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Having re-assembled at the gorge of the kloof, we
marched out about a mile further where the bush was
more open, and at sunset bivouacked for the night, very
glad to rest our weary limbs after the severe mountain
work of the last thirteen hours. From the returns sent
in at night to the Colonel, it appeared that our column
had killed 36 Kaffirs, taken 168 prisoners, and captured
41 horses, besides cattle.</p>

<p>At six o'clock next morning, we marched in a heavy
rain for our respective camps, the Rifle Brigade proceeding
to Nels, and we making our way round the spur of
the mountain to our little camp at Nieland's, which we
reached wet through about mid-day, delighted once more
to enjoy the luxury of a tent.</p>

<p>19th, Sunday.&mdash;Prayers were read by the senior officer
to the column, drawn up in the centre of the camp.</p>

<p>For the two following days we waited orders from the
Governor-General, riding round the neighbourhood, or
shooting quail and partridge. At the edge of the forest
by which we were encamped, we put up a couple of the
wildest old pigs imaginable, which rushed through the
thicket before we had recovered from the start they gave
us. In the wood we came upon a covey or two of wild
cocks and hens that took to wing like pheasants; but as
heavy metalled rifles carrying balls of eight to the pound
were not adapted for snap-shots in thick cover, we turned
our attention to pig-stalking; the game however led us
further than was quite prudent to follow without a larger
party, and we were obliged to abandon the pursuit.
These novel varieties of game, which may in time stock
the Kromme forests for future sportsmen, were, it is
almost unnecessary to say, the remains of the live stock of
the deserted farm where we were encamped, and which,
having been left behind in the flight of the owners, had
taken to the bush for subsistence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after returning to the camp, one of the sentries
reported a number of Kaffirs collecting on a piece of
open grass above the wood, clothing the lower part of
the mountain. On bringing our glasses to bear on
them, they proved to be large baboons, trooping out of
the forest in a continuous string, till we counted from
150 to 200; all seemed busily engaged in searching for
and grubbing up roots, at which they continued till
sunset, when they returned to the cover, following an
immense grey-headed old fellow that walked most
pompously at their head.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th, in accordance with his
Excellency's instructions to Colonel Eyre, to make a
final reconnaissance of the whole of the ground of the
last three days' operations, in order to ascertain its complete
clearance, we again climbed the Kromme Pass,
though this time by daylight. As we ascended, the evidences
of the fight became more frequent; rolling skulls,
dislodged by those in front, came bounding down between
our legs; the bones lay thick among the loose
stones in the sluits and gulleys, and the bush on either
side showed many a bleaching skeleton. A fine specimen
of a Kaffir head, I took the liberty of putting into
my saddle-bag, and afterwards brought home with me to
Scotland, where it has been much admired by phrenologists
for its fine development. The trees along the path
were scored by bullet marks in every direction. At the
point where our unfortunate Band-master had been
dragged into the bush to a fate so horrible, we involuntarily
stopped for a few moments. The ridges were again
traversed as before; and Colonel Eyre, separating his
column into three bodies, to search the kloof and forests
in and about the Iron Mountain, sent me in command
of the Light Companies of the 73rd and 74th, and a few
Irregulars, to search and clear the rocky krantzes opposite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and rejoin him in the Waterkloof valley. We
worked through the extensive bush both along the top
and at the base of the krantzes, searching all the caverns
and crevices with which they abounded, and rolling
down into the wood, stretching from our feet to the
base of the mountain, huge blocks of stone that cleared
all before them. We forced our difficult way, clambering
up and down rocks thickly covered with enormous aloes
in full flower, and tearing through the thorny cover,
guided only by constant bugling; catching peeps now
and then, from a higher crag, or through an opening in
the forest, of the main column in the deep valley,
slowly moving through the bush, their bugles scarcely
heard, as they sounded the halt, or advance, according
to our movements.</p>

<p>High up on the opposite mountain, the 3rd Column
worked its way like ourselves among the forest-clothed
crags, scaling the steepest cliffs, swarming and scrambling
among huge masses of detached rock, notwithstanding
the heat of the weather, and climbing higher and
higher, till so diminished, as to be visible only when
the sun shone on their red coats. On the other side,
we looked down on Colonel Buller's column, in the
Waterkloof valley, throwing rockets into the inaccessible
krantzes, and skirmishing through the bush. We found
the bodies of two dead Kaffirs; numerous heaps of
chewed root round the old fires on every part of the
lofty ledge where we were; and in the crevices of the
rocks all sorts of Kaffir ornaments and utensils; and
came on a village of empty huts, to which we set fire;
but no Kaffirs were to be seen, high or low, so we
descended the steep side of the mountain into the Waterkloof,
and rejoined the column already bivouacking in
the bush. With the exception of a few dead bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
they had met with no signs of the enemy. The whole
district was cleared.</p>

<p>Towards nightfall the tops of the heights that towered
round us were hidden in the clouds, and a drizzling rain
came on, which drove us under the shelter of the scattered
bushes among which we had made our bivouac.
The moaning wind, that bent the tops of the higher trees,
soon increased to a gale, howling along the valley, while
the cold driving rain swept over us in the most pitiless
manner, and with a steady determination that augured
a night of it. It was in vain the shivering horses turned
their tails to the storm, or the drenched and shapeless
heaps of humanity, stretched on the ground, pulled their
wet blankets more closely round them; for the pelting
storm and searching wind were not to be avoided, and a
day of excessive fatigue to the men was succeeded by a
night of sleepless discomfort. We were but a degree
better under our patrol tents; for though they kept the
rain off above, in a great measure, the ground was so
flooded, that we lay in pools of water, while myriads of
fleas, (we were on the site of an old kraal, of which, however,
they were the only remaining sign,) driven from the
wet ground, took refuge in unusual force on such portions
of our bodies as were above water mark. Our only consolation
(for we had one) was that it was too cold and wet
for any snakes to be about, though the valley was said
to abound with them. It did not require the "rouse" to
awaken us, even at the early hour of three next morning;
we were too glad to be moving, and busied ourselves in
feeding and saddling our shivering horses, collecting firewood,
and helping our benumbed servants to pack up
the patrol-tents and saddle-bags; the rain still coming
steadily down, and the darkness such, that we had the
greatest difficulty in finding anything once laid down on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the ground. We marched up the valley, toiling up a
clayey path, or rather stream of mud, leading up to the
heights, which were so completely covered by clouds, as
to render it difficult to find our way; the cold intense.
Crossing the "Horseshoe," we descended the steep ridge
leading down into Fullers Hoek, not a living Kaffir to
be seen anywhere. In the Hoek we found the 91st,
under Major Forbes, bivouacked on the long grass,
their drenched clothes clinging so closely to them, that
they looked as if they had passed the night in the river.
Half a mile further on we halted. Fancy men dripping
from every thread, kneeling in the mud, with eyes watering
from the thick smoke, and puffing away at a heap of
wet branches, surmounted by a kettle of cold water, or
with benumbed fingers trying to strike a light, and you
see us halted for breakfast. In another hour we were
again on foot, and after a march of twelve miles, passing
on the way through the Blinkwater Camp, reached Fort
Beaufort, the 73rd encamping on their former ground,
while we waded the river waist-deep, and marched to
the barracks.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, returning from Ely, where I had
been sent with an ammunition escort, we met Colonel
Eyre's column <i>en route</i> for the Amatolas, whence they
shortly afterwards expelled Uithaalder, killing about
thirty of his people, and taking several stand of arms
and 150 head of cattle; burning his Laager, and erecting
a permanent defensible Post in its place.</p>

<p>Having a day to spare, I rode out to Lieuwe Fontein,
of which Post my brother had, some time previously,
been appointed Commandant, with a garrison of 74th
and Mounted Levies. We had excellent buck shooting
in the open bush around the station, and killed a
singular diver on the vley, with curious palmated feet, the
three toes being quite detached, and in form and appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
like beautiful leaves. The situation, like most
of the frontier Posts, was one that would have afforded
a man of contemplative mind ample opportunity for
undisturbed reflection, being twelve miles from the
nearest dwelling, and not a living soul approaching the
place the day long, excepting twice a week, when the
post-riders met there, and the weekly train of waggons
outspanned under the walls. At night, after the gates
were locked and the keys brought in to the Commandant,
he might sit till daylight without hearing a
single sound to break the oppressive silence, except the
measured tread of the sentinel and the occasional howl
of a hyæna or jackal. Next evening the solitude was relieved
by the arrival of the up and down mails; two
small clouds of red dust rising above the scattered
clumps of bush, grew nearer and nearer, till at last the
two parties of mounted men were seen descending the
opposite hills at the same time, and rapidly approaching
the Post, their arms glittering in the setting sun. As
they remained within the Post till daylight, I rode back
to Beaufort with an escort; the cool refreshing morning
air fragrant with the perfume of flowering shrubs. On
the way I had some good sport, getting shots at a beautiful
pair of blue cranes, a flock of wild duck on a vley,
some wild Guinea fowl running along the road, and at
some monkeys. The mail was, unfortunately, rather
late getting in that morning.</p>

<p>About a week after this I accompanied an escort
going to the fortified camps in the Waterkloof. The
Rifle Brigade were quartered there, and with the 60th
and 91st, which occupied the forts on the heights, effectually
held what we had taken with so much labour; not
a Kaffir was left in the whole neighbourhood; officers
daily went out from the camps shooting alone in places
where, a month before, a column would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
attacked. The valley, in many parts, smelt most pestilentially
from the number of dead Kaffirs in the bush.
A puppy dog, belonging to H&mdash;&mdash;, brought the arm of
one into his tent unobserved, and began to play with it
under the bed, a fact of which his master was soon
made disagreeably conscious.</p>

<p>October 17th.&mdash;Lieut.-Col. MacDuff, lately appointed
to the 74th Highlanders, which had lost two commanding
officers in so short a time, arrived at head-quarters,
and assumed the command of the regiment and the
garrison. We were glad once more to have a Colonel at
our head, and, not less so, one who had seen good service
and hard fighting on other fields.</p>

<p>A few days subsequently, as we were sitting under the
wide verandah in front of the mess-room, the sleepy
noontide stillness of the town was suddenly broken by
the "alarm" and "assembly" sounding from our barracks;
the "boot and saddle" from the Cavalry stables;
and the <i>cow-horn rally</i> from the Fingo kraals. The
Kaffirs had swept off a herd of cattle out-grazing,
wounded one of the native police, and shot the horse of
another. In a very short time I was trudging away as
of old, with a party of Infantry and Levies to Post
Victoria, which we reached before sunset. Here the
mounted men came up with the pursuit, dispersed the
enemy in all directions, and retook the whole of the
cattle, our only casualty one man wounded.</p>

<p>I sent the cattle back to Fort Beaufort, and bivouacked
for the night with the Infantry at the ruins; but it was
not to be a night of undisturbed repose. We had hardly
lain down when we were most savagely attacked by
musquitoes; and a slapping of faces and lighting of
pipes began on all sides. Having at last successfully
dodged them by laying a branch over my face, and
thrusting my hands into my pockets, I flattered myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
with hopes of sleep, but a suspicious rustling among
the plucked broom under my head, made my blood run
cold at the idea of its being a cobra capello, and I rolled
away on the other side; having got a lighted brand
from the fire, one or two of the men getting up to assist
me, everything was turned over with our ramrods, but no
snake was found. The same noise, however, began again
soon after I lay down, but persuading myself that it
was some lizard or insect, I at last went to sleep. In
the morning, under the warm stuffing of the saddle that
had been my pillow, a fine puff adder lay coiled up.</p>

<p>On our way back, at sunrise, we blazed away right
and left at bush buck, and pheasants which we put
up in scores. The bush was very beautiful, glowing
with the fragrant golden mimosa and the snowy
jessamine, mingled with the blue plumbago, the cluytea,
and geranium; the ground too covered with mesembryanthemum,
was one sheet of glowing pink. Along the
deserted grass-grown road, doves, everywhere abundant,
were unusually numerous, running along the ground
before us and flying on from tree to tree like flocks of
tame pigeons. On gaining the more open country we
found ourselves again among the young locusts, now
considerably grown, and turned to a reddish brown.
The scattered bushes, stripped of every leaf, were loaded
with them, hanging like swarms of bees from every
branch and twig; for acres together the ground was
literally alive, and the "veldt" behind them bare to the
very earth. The evil became worse as we approached
Beaufort, where the cattle, from their numbers, were
almost starving, for it was hazardous driving them to
any great distance, and already they went so far from
the town that a considerable part of the day was lost in
taking them to and from pasture.</p>

<p>November 3rd.&mdash;The town to-day was thrown into excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
by a serious fray between two rival clans of
Fingoes; the "casus belli" was not easy to discover, but
a young lady appeared to be at the bottom of it. The
extensive green flat between their kraals and the burial
ground was covered by two long extended lines of men
armed with "keeries," opposed to each other, and advancing
or retiring as one or the other gained a temporary
advantage; each Fingo carried a kaross, or
blanket, over the left arm, as a shield, and a second
keerie, held like the old quarter-staff, exhibiting great
skill and adroitness in parrying and delivering the tremendous
and resounding blows; running, stooping, and
wheeling rapidly about with their whirling staves and
waving blankets, yelling in savage defiance; while hosts
of young women on both sides, armed with large stones,
filled the air with well-directed missiles. The scene was
most novel and exciting, and every one entered heartily
into it.</p>

<p>The stronger party having driven their adversaries
back on their kraal, began an attack on the huts, when
the prettiest light infantry practice imaginable followed;
the attacking force taking advantage of every rock, bush,
and bank, their keeries in their left hand ready for a
charge, assailed the defenders with showers of stones,
thrown with astonishing force and precision, while they
in turn kept up so hot a fire from the shelter of their
huts, assisted by the women and children, that for some
time neither gained much advantage, till, encouraged by
a tall active young fellow, whose face and naked body
were covered with blood and wounds, the assailants
rushed into the kraal, laying about them right and left,
knocking down and clearing all before them. The Commandant
of the garrison arriving at this juncture, ordered
the two principal Chiefs to put a stop to the affray
instantly. One of them, a grey-headed old man, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
short grizzly beard, ran from one to another, issuing his
orders to his 'captains,' and soon the tumult ended,
though the belligerents were in a very excited state.
Several of the champions had been stretched senseless
on the ground, one or two of whom afterwards died,
and most were covered with blood. There could not
have been fewer than 300 men, besides women, engaged
in the affray.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
EXPEDITION ACROSS THE GREAT ORANGE RIVER AGAINST THE
BASUTO CHIEF MOSHESH.</h2>


<p>Nov. 9th.&mdash;The surmises of some impending movement,
which for several days had formed the chief topic of conversation,
were confirmed by the arrival of an order
from head-quarters for the assembling, on the 20th inst.,
of a force of 2500 troops at Burghersdorp, a Dutch town,
two days' march beyond the Orange River.</p>

<p>The object of the expedition was to demand satisfaction
from the Basuto Chief, Moshesh, whose "Great Place"
lay some hundred miles beyond the Orange River, for
the constant and increasing depredations and attacks of
his tribe, and of the neighbouring minor Chiefs, his
vassals, on the Boers of the Orange River Territory, and
on the Barolong Chief, Moroko. The latter was a
staunch ally of our Government, but did not dare alone
attempt reprisals on a Chief so much more powerful,
while the former, as being under British rule and protection,
were prohibited from avenging themselves.</p>

<p>The cattle of both had been swept off by hundreds, and
their herdsmen killed, by this dreaded Chieftain. He
openly derided the power of the British, and after taunting
Moroko for his blind adherence to friends who were
not able to assist him, whose long-talked-of coming was
a fable, "an old story they had heard ever since they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
were children," threatened him with immediate and total
destruction unless he at once gave up all further connexion
with us, and joined him at Thaba Bossiou. He
also boasted of having already conquered three nations&mdash;the
Corannas, Maulatees, and the Griquas, and had only
to take the trouble of marching to Thaba 'Nchu to "eat
up" the Barolongs, as themselves knew; as for the
English, whose power was an idle bugbear, he could
settle them any day. Many of the Boers living on the
borders of his country were fleeing from their farms, in
apprehension of war, or from the insecurity of their
flocks and herds, while Moroko lived in daily expectation
of being swept from the face of the earth, with his
whole tribe.</p>

<p>The force with which it was intended to demonstrate
to the Basuto Chief that the coming of the English was
no idle tale, was to be composed of the 2nd Queen's,
the 74th Highlanders, detachments of the 43rd Light
Infantry, the 73rd and Rifle Brigade, the 12th Lancers,
a demi-battery of Artillery, and the Cape Corps.</p>

<p>It was hoped by his Excellency that such a demonstration
might bring the contumacious Chief to his
senses, without proceeding to extremities.</p>

<p>Our column, under Colonel MacDuff, consisting of
two guns, 74th Highlanders, and detachment of Cape
Corps, was to march from Fort Beaufort on the 11th.
The intervening two days, during which our detachments
were relieved, my brother's among the rest, were fully
occupied in preparing the requisite outfit for an expedition
of nearly three months in the desert. In addition
to the daily issue of rations, which was not sufficient of
itself to maintain an able-bodied man in full exercise,
both officers and men carried with them private supplies
in the waggons; the officers messing by companies, <i>i. e.</i>,
a Captain and two Subalterns, had a box in common for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
their supplies, whence they drew every three or four
days, or when necessary. Mine contained, in tin cases&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>The pickled cabbage was an excellent and most necessary
substitute for vegetables, which were not to be had
for love or money, in consequence of which scurvy had
already appeared among the men. Besides the two pairs
of serviceable boots, and three pairs of socks, which each
man started with, we took barrels of both in the waggons,
as also plenty of leather for supply and repair on
the march. As we went from store to store in the
town, purchasing the thousand and one lesser necessaries
required for such a journey, as much interest and excitement
were displayed by the townspeople as if we
had been going to the Great Lake, and as much was
felt by ourselves at the prospect of visiting new tribes
and a new country, and whether engaged in active warfare
or not, at any rate of seeing for ourselves those vast
and wonderful herds of wild game, lions, zebras, ostriches,
springbok, gemsbok, blesbok, and wild beasts, which
from school days we had pictured in imagination roaming
over those boundless plains.</p>

<p>On the 10th, all our preparations completed, the last
waggon loaded, and the last soldier hauled away from
his "doch an dhurris" with friends, both black and
white, the column fell in, the Rifle Brigade Band struck
up, and we marched out of the town, accompanied for
the first mile by all the officers of the garrison, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
crowd of men, women, and children, of all colours. We
halted the first night at the entrance of the Blinkwater
Poort.</p>

<p>The third day, after seeing nothing but a few deserted
farms, we reached the ruins of Fort Armstrong, destroyed
by General Somerset at an early period of the war, when
in possession of the Hottentot Rebels. The place consisted
of a strong square tower, surrounded by some
score of wattle and daub houses, standing on a singularly
isolated, or rather peninsulated hill. Of this the Hottentots
of the Kat River Mission had taken possession,
turning out the European occupants, in a most inclement
night, to escape as best they might across the mountains
to Whittlesea; themselves living in the most disgraceful
licentiousness and depravity, offering indignities to the
English women, plundering the farmers, and revelling
on the spoil.</p>

<p>General Somerset, in order to break up this nest of
robbers and traitors, appeared before it on the 23rd of
February, 1851, with a force of troops and Burghers,
offering them, at the last moment, terms of capitulation,
which, however, they scorned, though they acted on his
humane counsel, and sent their women and children from
the Fort out of the way of danger. On their removal he
at once attacked the place, shelling the Fort, which he
stormed and carried; in two hours reducing it to ruins.</p>

<p>Between 30 and 40 of these misguided creatures
were killed, 160 taken prisoners, 100 stand of arms, besides
several waggons, captured, and about 400 women
and children; the General's only casualties being three
killed and twenty wounded. The place presented at
the time of our visit a most desolate appearance; nothing
remained but bare walls, shattered and fire-scorched, the
ground strewed with fragments of the dismantled Fort,
exploded shells, and broken furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>We encamped at sundown close to Elands Post, where
we were joined by a company of the 74th Highlanders
quartered there, their place being taken by a company of
the Rifle Brigade that had accompanied us thus far
for the purpose.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the following morning, we commenced
the ascent of the steep mountain in front of us; the view
becoming at every step more and more beautiful, till at
the summit of the Pass there opened upon us a glorious
panorama, stretching from the forest at our feet to the
blue hills beyond Graham's Town; Elands Post, nestling
in its wooded nook below, dwindled to a white speck,
and the Kat River winding away down a lovely valley
till lost in a sea of bush covering the solitary expanse.
A little further on we came in sight of the rear-guard
of the Fort Hare column, the distance of a day's march
being preserved between each; soon after their red
coats had disappeared over a still higher ridge, we
encamped, early in the afternoon, on the Sarropit's
Hill to rest and feed the oxen. Before us rose the
Elandsberg Mountain, with its grand towering cliffs of
gray basaltic rock, from which sloped away the greenest
and smoothest grass, a relief so delightful after the
brown burnt up pastures of the valleys, that the eye
rested on it with untiring pleasure. Next morning we
were again off at four o'clock.</p>

<p>To avoid a repetition that may be as tiresome as the
reality, it may suffice to mention, once for all, that
during this expedition we were on the march every
morning at that hour, often earlier; accomplishing from
five to ten miles before breakfast, according to the
distance between the springs in our route.</p>

<p>So steep was the ascent of the next steppe, that even
with double teams and terrific jamboking, it took well
nigh two hours to get some thirty waggons up a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
mile. At the top of this range the face of the country
completely changed; not a tree or bush was to be seen;
undulating green plains lay on every side.</p>

<p>After two days across this kind of country, having
only seen six rheebok in a wild rocky poort, we halted
about a couple of miles from Whittlesea, a miserable
forsaken-looking collection of Fingo kraals and small
houses standing in the middle of a bare brown plain,
enclosed by hills still browner and more bare. On the
same plain, and about a mile distant, the white houses of
Shiloh, a Moravian Missionary station, peeping from
clumps of orange trees, looked very pretty, heightened in
some measure from contrast with the surrounding sterility.
Whittlesea has been rendered famous by the
series of attacks it sustained, and gallantly withstood,
under Captain Tylden, R.A., who no fewer than thirteen
times defeated and put to flight large attacking bodies
of Tambookies and Rebel Hottentots. This was our
most remote Post; and here we were joined by the
Grenadier Company of the 74th, which for some little
time had been encamped at the Settlement.</p>

<p>We left the plain by another steep hill, having been
gradually ascending from the time of leaving Beaufort;
through the whole distance, and as far as we went up
the country it was a series of steppes rising higher the
further we penetrated. At the top of this hill we
entered on a vast plain, stretching away to the foot of
the bare rugged mountains in the far distance. Colonel
Eyre's column was again seen about four miles ahead.</p>

<p>We encamped for the night at the Brak River, on the
open plain; a dreary lonely spot. Close to our camp were
three kraals, in which as many Tambookie herdsmen
and their families were living. They were quite naked
and very wretched looking. The women brought us
goats' milk, in grass baskets, for sale. Their idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
value of money, which they were very anxious to get,
lay in the number of pieces, refusing a sixpence for a
basket of sour milk, but accepting two silver three-penny
pieces with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>After marching about four miles next morning we
came to Kamastona, the 'great place' of the friendly
Chief, Kama. His dwelling, a high substantial building,
stood in the centre of the village, which was a large
collection of kraals, enclosed by earthen out-works. Its
situation and appearance were rather striking, standing
totally isolated on the plain, with a background of bare
scarped mountains rising in rugged grandeur to a great
height. Two miles further, and similarly situated, lay
another circular village, a Tambookie settlement, their
cattle and goats spread over the plain under a guard of
armed natives, whose wild appearance was heightened
by the surprise and wonder with which they regarded us.</p>

<p>The grass herbage was now succeeded by karroo
plains, covered with a kind of dwarf heath which the
cattle and horses had to put up with. We crossed the
Zwart Kei, at Stoffel Venter's, a Dutch Boer's farm,
lonely enough to satisfy any hermit; the sound of the
bagpipes brought out a family of lazy-looking Dutchmen,
with pipes in their mouths and hands in their
breeches pockets, with one or two fat women, who
waddled out and bumped down on the bench outside
the door, followed by a knot of bare-legged dirty children,
looking as phlegmatic as their seniors.</p>

<p>For miles along the vast plain, which was interspersed
with isolated mountains and rocky hills, we beheld in
the distance the lofty and singular mountain, called
"Twa Taffel Berg," with its two table-topped summits.</p>

<p>After seventeen miles we crossed the Honey Klip
River, running between high jungley banks, and halted
for the night; but before the waggon-train with our tents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
could get up, a thunder storm, which for some time had
been brewing in dark indigo clouds, burst over our heads,
and we were soaked to the skin by a tremendous down
pour of rain, which completely flooded the ground.</p>

<p>Since our departure from Elands Post, where we
took leave of trees and shrubs, we had been entirely dependent
for fuel on the dry dung of cattle and wild
game, scattered over the plains; following in the rear
of the other Column, which left but small gleanings
behind it, our men had to go far a-field, often wandering,
after a long day's march, a mile or two from the
camp to get sufficient to boil their coffee. Indeed, so
scarce and valuable was this commodity, that many used
their pockets and haversacs as receptacles for such portions
as they were lucky enough to pick up by the way.</p>

<p>It was a ten miles' march next morning before we
came to water for breakfast. The heat was very great,
and increased to an overpowering degree on entering a
narrow rocky defile, called Klaas Smidt's Poort, out of
which, after a three miles march, we emerged on a measureless
level plain, bounded only by the outlines of blue
mountains, which danced hazy and indistinct in the
heated air. In this cheerful situation was a solitary
Dutch farm-house; all around littering, untidy, and
neglected, with three or four huts to match for the Fingo
servants. Mrs. Grant's Glenburnie was a pattern of
neatness in comparison. Several of the inmates, for it
was a Laager, afterwards galloped over on rough little
horses to our camp, which was pitched two miles beyond.
Their astonishment at the bagpipes, and not less at
the dress of the Pipers, was extreme, crowding round
them with childish wonder, as they goodnaturedly played
reels, marches, strathspeys, and pibrochs; unconsciously
to themselves, they were little less objects of curiosity
in our eyes, differing so much from the Anglicised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Boer of the colony; stout heavy-built fellows, in short
round jackets of purple or sky-blue moleskin, with
huge broad-brimmed white hats, wrapped round with a
band of black crape, which a Dutchman wears not as a
sign of grief but a sort of finish to his beaver; stockingless
feet thrust into rough home-made veldt-schoenen,
with a heavy spur on the left one; a small jambok hanging
from his wrist; a clumsy roer; cow-horn powder-flask
at the side, and an untanned leather bullet-pouch&mdash;these,
with a green-stone pipe sticking in the mouth or
out of the waistcoat pocket, completed their equipment.
The only subject on which they became at all animated,
was guns and shooting; they were as much pleased
as surprised at the practice of some of our best shots
with the Minié rifle at ant-heaps at 1000 yards range.
Though the roer, from its large bore and weight of
metal, carries a great distance, it is not at all an accurate
weapon, as might be expected from its extraordinary
make and finish; an immense shapeless stock, a rough
flint lock, and an ivory 'sight' as large as a domino.</p>

<p>After trekking over miles the following morning
we halted for breakfast at the foot of the Stormberg
mountains, another steppe, or range, stretching east
and west as far as the eye could see. The road up
being steep and winding, the effect was very peculiar,
as at every turn portions of the column were seen
one above another, while the long train of waggons
and the distant rear-guard were still creeping along
the plain below. We had a broiling climb of it;
on gaining the top, a vast green plain was again
before us, and after some miles further we camped
near a large vley of thick muddy water. The night, in
this elevated region, was as cold as the day had been
hot in the sultry plains, and though we piled every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
available article on our beds, we could not keep
warm. On striking a light next morning at the 'Rouse'
to dress and pack up by, the walls of the tent glistened
and sparkled with frozen moisture, and the
water in the basin was covered with a coating of ice as
thick as a half-crown. The poor horses felt the cold
severely; their bodies drawn together quite benumbed,
and the moisture from their breath hanging in hoar
frost about their nostrils. The mountain tops all round
were white with snow. It was, no doubt, the sudden
change of temperature, together with our light dress,
that made the cold so particularly severe, as I have
felt far less inconvenience in a Canadian winter, with
the mercury frozen in the thermometer.</p>

<p>After an eight miles march the sun became exceedingly
hot as we descended slightly towards the Stormberg
Spruit, a tributary of the Orange River; by the
time we got to our halt, in a wild bare spot, called
Sanna Spruits, close to a chaotic assemblage of singularly
fantastic rocks, we were very glad to get
under the friendly shade of their overhanging masses.
They were completely overrun with the 'dossies,'
supposed, by the way, to be the 'coney' of Scripture,
and on the highest point were a number of
beautiful blue ibis. We shot several at first, but
afterwards they kept far out of range, circling round
and round in the air, at a great height. The Boers
call them "wild turkeys," from the curious red head,
which is quite bare and hard, and looks just like
sealing wax. The bird is about the size of a large
game-cock, with a long curved red beak and legs of
the same colour, the general plumage of an iridescent
green and purplish blue, with brown wing coverts.
Having got into camp much earlier than usual, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
were enabled to make soup and wash our shirts.
About the middle of the day following, we fell in
with horns of hartebeest and springbok here and
there by the wayside, and a few hours later, saw a
small herd of each scudding across the plain a couple
of miles off. The heat became intense, we were choked
and blinded by clouds of fine sand, and after a long
and weary march, came to a halt in a barren scorching
karroo at the foot of a rugged hill. The silence
and absence of life were most oppressive.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, after eleven days march we reached
Burghersdorp, where we could see, long before we
came up, the tents of Lieut.-Colonel Eyre's column,
which was encamped about half a mile from the town.
After pitching the tents, our men were soon scattered
far and wide over the plain, gathering dung. The
cavalry marched in next morning.</p>

<p>Though within ten minutes' walk of the town, no
one would have guessed its proximity, as it was built
in a gorge between two hills, the bare plain immediately
around presenting no more signs of life than
the deserts we had just passed through. Built within
the last three years, the little town boasts of several
large and capital stores, two inns, and a large thatched
Dutch church, with pea-green doors and window frames.
The stores, in which everything one could think of
was to be bought, saddlery, groceries, ironmongery;
Gunter's preserves, Dutch cheeses, Crosse and Blackwell's
pickles; clocks, roers, ploughs, rifles, crockery,
stationery, wines, spirits, Bass's pale ale; fiddles,
mirrors, pots, pans, and kettles; ostrich feathers,
cases of gin, tobacco, and ten thousand things besides,
were filled all day long with a crowd of officers of
all arms and corps with leather-patched uniform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
mahogany-coloured faces, and long beards, trying on
boots, buying preserved meats, and stuffing their pockets
with bundles of cheroots, boxes of lucifer matches,
and pots of cold cream to anoint their sun-blistered
noses. Then there were Dutchmen, in purple trowsers,
saluting each other in the politest manner possible,
lifting the craped hat with the left hand and shaking
the proffered fist with the other, discussing politics and
cattle, their vrouws and daughters busy purchasing
dresses or household supplies; while Bushmen and
Griquas elbowed their way in and out for bottles of
Hollands.</p>

<p>As the only chance of getting fresh vegetables was
to eat them at the inns, they were filled with officers,
devouring green food like so many herbivora, making
up for the past and laying in for the future.</p>

<p>The camp was besieged all day long by visitors;
rough Boers, with strings of colts for sale; townspeople
on foot; and respectably dressed, well-mounted Dutchmen,
with very pretty girls in pink or sky-blue riding
habits, who rode up and down the lines, stared unceremoniously
into the tents, and when the 'warning,' 'dinner
pipes' or 'assembly' were played, flocked round the
unfortunate "Piper of the day" with as much astonishment
as if he had just dropped from the moon, drawling
out the constant exclamation "Allamachtig! Allamachtig!"
We were all struck with the great respect shown
by the young Dutchmen and boys to their seniors, lifting
off their hats whenever addressed by them.</p>

<p>A party of officers went out shooting a few miles from
the camp, and fell in with some herds of game, my
brother and Captain Knox, 73rd, each bowling over a
springbok; and Gawler, 73rd, bringing back a fine
blesbok behind his saddle. We were now in the height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of summer; the sun was most overpowering. The sandy
plain danced in the hot air like the top of a kiln;
inside our tents, though covered with blankets, the heat
was insupportable; and without there was not a tree or
a rock to be seen that could shelter us from the scorching
rays. To add to our discomfort, the place was overrun
with tarantulas, or, as the men insisted on calling them,
"triantelopes," and scorpions, which we constantly found
in the tents, and occasionally in our bedding or boots.
Two puff adders were killed, which the men had found
under their blankets in the morning.</p>

<p>On the 27th, his Excellency, the Governor-General,
arrived with his Staff and escort, all the Dutch in the
place going out to meet him a mile from the town, and
firing a <i>feu-de-joie</i>. As nothing gives a Boer greater
pleasure than firing off his roer with as heavy a charge
as it will carry, it was kept up a long time, in a very
independent manner, and in all parts of the town at
once. His Excellency afterwards rode down our ranks.</p>

<p>The camp being pitched in <i>line</i>, was more than a mile
long, and it was quite a walk from our tents on the
extreme left to those of the Artillery on the right flank.
In the close and sultry evenings, when sauntering up
and down the long street of illuminated canvas, it was
amusing to see the attitudes and employments of the
different inmates of the wide open tents; here a solitary
individual, in shirt sleeves, his candle stuck in an
empty bottle, writing on the top of a box; there a
quiet party playing a rubber; in the next a couple of
Subalterns, joint occupants, stretched on their rough
beds, reading the last <i>Grahams Town Journal</i>,
or the soiled and crumpled fragment of an old
English newspaper; in some, orderly-officers, cap and
sword on the table, snatching a few moments' broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
slumber; dinner parties in others, and loungers everywhere,
from whose tents issued wreaths of smoke and
sounds of merry voices. Turning into another street,
one saw knots of Sergeants squatted cross-legged,
writing "orders," from the dictation of the Sergeant-Major,
and Adjutants scribbling away among busy clerks;
while sentries paced in front of quiet, solemn looking
marquees, the abodes of Colonels, Quarter-Masters-General
and other "big wigs." Further on were tents
full of tailors and shoemakers, repairing the wear and
tear of former marches and preparing against others
to come; commissariat contractors weighing and issuing
forage and rations; and farriers shoeing horses by candlelight.
Outside the lines, round a hundred smouldering
fires, where the men collected, not for warmth,
but to light their pipes, were endless parties of
soldiers of all corps and uniforms; then long lines
of horses, and neatly ranged saddles; and beyond all,
the guard tents and sentries, with a perfect village of
waggons.</p>

<p>At "tattoo" a sudden stir runs through the camp;
picquets are inspected and reports collected by orderly-officers,
who have mysterious interviews in the marquees;
the trumpets and bugles ring out the "last post;" and
the Pipers play "Farewell to Lochaber," recalling
many a distant and very different scene; the fires are
deserted; the different parties break up and disperse;
in ten minutes more the bugles sound "lights out," and
the men's tents shine white and cold in the pale moonlight.</p>

<p>All the time we were at Burghersdorp we had constant
sand-storms, filling the air with a red cloud, and
colouring everything inside our carefully closed tents
with the same rusty hue as outside. With the westerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
wind came a wonderful flight of locusts, passing over for
hours and literally darkening the air.</p>

<p>On the 28th, his Excellency inspected the whole of
the troops; the line, at "open order," in front of the
camp, extending about a mile in length, and we were
formed into Brigades for the ensuing march. The First
Brigade, under Lieut.-Col. MacDuff, 74th Highlanders,
consisted of the 2nd Queen's, the 74th Highlanders, and
a rocket battery. The Second under Major Pinckney,
73rd regiment, of the 43rd Light Infantry, the 73rd,
the Rifle Brigade, and a rocket battery (Colonel Eyre
commanding the Division), and a Cavalry Brigade under
Lieut.-Col. Napier, composed of the 12th Lancers, Artillery,
and Cape Corps. The heat of the sun was so
great that several of the men fainted as we stood on
parade, and one had a sun-stroke. Later in the day we
were visited by violent whirlwinds, that whisked some
of the tents into the air among clouds of sand and small
gravel, levelling many others in their course.</p>

<p>The Cavalry marched for the Orange River; and at
daylight next morning the Second Brigade followed, the
First bringing up the rear the morning following.</p>

<p>At 9 o'clock, when we halted for our morning meal, we
were thankful to get under the shadow of the waggons:
a man of the Rifle Brigade had a <i>coup-de-soleil</i>. A
twenty miles' trying march through a burning desert
country brought us by sunset to our halting place, near
a small vley; but we had no sooner got our tents up
than a whirlwind threw half of them down again, enveloping
us for a few minutes in such a cloud of sand,
that we could not see a yard before us. The water in
these stagnant pools, that simmer all day in the sun,
and at night are used as baths by herds of wild game,
is the most villanous mixture of mud, dung, and green
scum that can be imagined;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> as thick as pea-soup, and
full of aquatic insects. Even where the water was
clear, we often found it so <i>brak</i> as to be even worse
than in its gruel form; and of the two descriptions of
<i>salt</i> and <i>sweet</i> brak, we hardly knew which was the
worst; the brandy used to neutralize its bad effects, dysentery
and diarrh&oelig;a, turning it as black as ink in a
moment.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>CROSSING THE ORANGE RIVER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The march of next morning again lay through a burning
sun-baked plain, without a single object to vary the
monotony of its barren desolation, the only sign of life
being an occasional paauw or koran. But at the end of
about seven miles a wonderful and glorious change met
our delighted eyes; from a low undulating ridge we
suddenly looked down on the broad silvery expanse of
the Great Orange River, flowing between richly wooded
banks of warm red earth and rock, in front of us
three or four lovely green islets adorning its bosom.
The transition from the dreary sterility of the burning
plains of the last twenty-one days, shady trees in
lieu of bare karroo, and miles of clear sparkling water
instead of muddy vleys, was most delightful, independently
of the natural beauties of the scene itself.</p>

<p>The tents of the Second Brigade and the Cavalry,
which had already crossed, were seen on the plain on the
other side the river. Halting at the top of the road
leading down a high bank to the drift or ford, the men
were ordered to take off their boots and trews, and
pack their ammunition pouches in their blankets. The
effect was most absurd,&mdash;nearly 1000 men standing in
the ranks in column of companies, with bare legs, their
unmentionables on their heads or round their necks, and
their boots and socks dangling from the muzzles of their
firelocks. The waggons, with the wheels rheimed, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
let gradually down the bank by drag-ropes. Thus we
crossed the river, at this point nearly a quarter of a mile
in breadth; the water reaching to the men's middles,
and to our saddle-flaps. The current was strong and
rapid, rushing with great force between the legs of man
and horse, endangering their equilibrium, and carrying
some score of dogs far down the current. The sensation
occasioned by the swiftly running stream was most bewildering.
I felt at first as though I were darting up the
river at railway speed, then so giddy that I clutched
my horse's mane to prevent myself falling off.</p>

<p>All having crossed, the first thing we did after pitching
our tents by those of the other Brigade, was to rush
to the river and plunge into its cooling flood, swimming
and splashing about under the shade of the weeping
willows that dipped into it; every body in a perfect
frenzy of delight, many actually lying in the water
smoking, and the whole breadth of the river covered
over with heads, as if by wild fowl; for every man in
the Division bathed twice or thrice over in the course
of the day.</p>

<p>The shade of the large olive trees and willows,
was hardly less grateful than the deliciously cooling
stream. The sultry tents were deserted, except by those
on duty, and all flocked to the green shady banks of the
river, where we remained till sunset. The shrill ringing
of the cicada resounded in every branch all day long.
Many of the men turned out unsuspected fishing-tackle,
and having cut rods from the trees, very soon caught
abundance of fine fish. They were of two kinds; a sort
of coarse mullet, and a long ugly fish, with a blue skin
and a number of fleshy filaments hanging from his under
jaw. The Dutchmen called them <i>barga</i>; they were excellent
eating, and ran from one to four pounds weight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Near the drift and on the opposite side of the river,
was a small house and garden, to which Bruce and I,
with our trews and boots round our necks, waded
across, partly to explore, and partly to see if there were
any vegetables to be had; the stones were so dreadfully
sharp to our feet that before we were half way
over we repented; but as a hundred eyes were upon us,
we kept manfully on, though with many <i>ohs!</i> and <i>ahs!</i>
The people were very kind and obliging, but there was
little to be got for our trouble. Along the edge of the
river are found numbers of agates, and cornelians, with
green serpentine, and we picked up a great many of them;
mine were subsequently cut and polished by Sanderson
of Edinburgh, and turned out very good specimens.</p>

<p>This magnificent river is more than eleven hundred
miles in length, rising in the Blue Mountains, and flowing
right across the continent into the South Atlantic.
With great regret, we left this Elysium of the desert
next morning at daylight, and were again trekking
across the arid plain northwards. Our halt was at a
place called Ranakin, though why it should be called
anything at all, more than the rest of the desert, from
which it in no way differed, we could not imagine.</p>

<p>The mail from the Colony came in soon after we had
pitched our Camp, bringing English letters and news, in
which I found myself gazetted to a Company. The heat
had all day been excessive, and was succeeded at nightfall
by a storm of <i>dry</i> thunder and lightning, as L&mdash;&mdash;
called it. The flashes, of a blue and rose-colour, were
very vivid; the camp one moment as light as day&mdash;showing
the long line of white tents, the distant sentries, and
every moving figure&mdash;and the next as dark as pitch.</p>

<p>We inspanned at the usual hour the day following,
and trekked through a dreary stony country; a solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Dutch farm-house, about eleven miles distant, was the
only sign of life visible far or near.</p>

<p>Finding the first vley dried up, we had a twelve
miles' march before breakfast. Two or three Dutch
Boers, probably belonging to the lonely dwelling in the
distance, made their appearance on horseback, with
their vrouws or daughters behind them, riding astride
like the Kaffir and Fingo women, and jogged along with
us for some distance, ignorant of the amusement they
afforded the men. The conversation turned chiefly on the
disturbed and dangerous state of their country, and they
told us that all their native servants had gone off two
nights before.</p>

<p>Another heavy thunder storm suddenly burst on us,
accompanied with such torrents of rain that we were
soon wet through; the sluits running like rivers, and the
plain so flooded, in less than an hour, as to resemble a
lake; the men constantly plunging into the deep gullies.
Though disagreeable enough, with our clothing soaked
through and clinging to our bodies, it was much less
so than the steaming condition we were thrown into
when the sun broke out again.</p>

<p>The Governor-General, with the Cavalry Division and
Second Brigade, we found already encamped on the
opposite side of the Caledon River at the Commissie
Drift, which we reached in the afternoon, their tents
stretching for a great distance along the edge of the
high steep bank.</p>

<p>We waded through the rapid stream, which is confined
between high wooded banks like the Orange River,
and marching through the camp, pitched our tents in
Brigade on the extreme left.</p>

<p>For the next three days that we remained here in
standing camp, we had constant heavy showers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
completely flooded the lower ground within and round
the camp, though the weather was warm and the heat of
the sun between the storms very great.</p>

<p>Our reduced commissariat was replenished from the
neighbouring and very appropriately named station of
Smithfield, where a large magazine had been previously
formed, guarded till our arrival by the Burgher force of
the Field-Cornetcy.</p>

<p>The fishing here was better than at the Orange River,
and the banks were soon lined with anglers, many of
whom were very successful. Some of us caught from
40 lbs. to 50 lbs. weight of mullet and barga, with worms
or locusts, the latter lying in thousands along the banks.
Many agates and cornelians were picked up, and one or
two pieces of onyx; sardine, opal and chalcedony are often
found; but we saw none. The hippopotamus formerly
abounded in this stream, but has entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Among the other luxuries of these rivers ought to be
included that of firewood, a valued boon to the men,
and a great improvement to our beef and meal scons,
which had a rather peculiar flavour when done over a
cow-dung fire.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning the whole Division paraded at
6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> for divine service, forming in "contiguous column
of brigades," on the left of the camp; a missionary of
the English Church from Smithfield read the prayers.</p>

<p>Though two days before we had waded across the
river only knee deep, it had on the 6th risen nearly
fifteen feet; the boiling eddying flood bearing along in
its resistless course masses of grass and broken branches,
with huge trees tumbling over and over in the whirling
pools. Many of the men amused themselves by swimming
about in mid-current, getting astride the floating
trunks, and sailing rapidly down the stream. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
quantity of drift-wood greatly interfered with the operations
of the pontoon under the charge of Lieutenant
Siborne, R.E., in getting over waggons with supplies. The
cattle, after being forced into the water with great
trouble, were swept a long way down the river, many
of them sticking for a time in most ridiculous positions
in the trees growing on the bank.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th, the Head-Quarters and
Second Brigade having left the camp an hour before, we
marched at 6 o'clock, arriving, after some miles, at the first
halting place just as they were quitting it. We passed two
solitary Dutch farms, for which, as usual when such <i>raræ
aves</i> came in sight, five or six officers dashed off across
country at full gallop to forage for their respective messes,
provided with empty bottles for goat's milk, and plenty of
small change; overtaking the column again, with perhaps
an enormous cabbage and a couple of old fowls with bleeding
necks hanging from the saddle, or a bunch of onions,
and a handkerchief full of eggs. Late in the day a good
many springbok were seen, which we 'jagged' for some
distance, getting plenty of long shots; but the sight of a
large <i>wildebeest</i>, or gnu, cantering leisurely along the
plain, drew off all the hunters in pursuit of the nobler
game. Having already done up my horse and expended
all my ammunition, I could only follow him with a
wistful gaze. He was a splendid fellow, as large as an
ox, and came so close past me, as I led my horse back
towards the column, that I could have hit him with a
stone. Mortified as I was at my ill luck in having at
such a moment an unloaded rifle and empty pouch, I
stood fixed in admiration as he came wildly bounding
along, his massive bristling head bent down, whisking
his white tail, while his fierce eyes and recurved horns
gave him a most formidable appearance.</p>

<p>We had fairly entered the game district, and as our
Brigade was in front the following morning, some of
us rode on about a mile ahead, so as to come on
the herds before they were alarmed by the approach
of the column. Very shortly after daylight we spied a
large herd of springbok at half a mile distant, and
following a slight hollow gained five hundred yards
before they discovered us, when away they went, springing
twenty feet at a bound, and we after them in full
chase, firing away right and left. Two of them being
wounded and appearing every moment likely to fall
into our hands, led us on for a considerable distance,
when finding further pursuit useless we pulled up.
We were miles away from the column, which was nowhere
to be seen; there was nothing whatever to
guide us, and as in our windings and turnings,
we had lost all idea of our course, we could only
guess what direction to steer. The silence was awful,
not a living creature was to be seen besides ourselves,
and we felt as small as we looked in the vast plain
stretching before and around us in endless undulating
ridges of brown grass. After a time we saw a large
herd of black looking animals grazing two or three
miles distant, which our glasses showed us were wildebeest.
For several hours we rode steadily on in a north-westerly
course, and at last, to our great delight, beheld, a
few miles off, a point or two to the north, the white tops
of the waggons outspanned. When we rode in to
bivouac, having bagged a fine rheebok by the way, the
Brigade was falling in after an hour's halt.</p>

<p>Having leave from the Colonel Commanding to rejoin
the column at the evening halting place, we exchanged
our horses for the fresh ones led by the servants; and
replenishing our ammunition from the pack saddles, set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
off with three or four companions in the direction of the
herd of wildebeest. We soon fell in with several large
herds of springbok, though they were too wild to allow of
our coming within rifle range; a few blesbok, the largest
of the antelope tribe, were sighted, but were equally wary.
From a low ridge we now saw the most magnificent sight;
on an immense plain hundreds of wildebeest grazed in
herds scattered far and near, with springbok and blesbok.
I shall never forget the exciting interest with
which, for the first time, we saw these noble animals
feeding in herds on their native plains, or the thrill of
pleasure it gave us as we watched them through the
telescope cropping the short brown herbage, switching
the flies from their dark glossy sides, and impatiently
stamping their delicate taper legs. As we lay concealed
behind some large stones, we observed the rest of
our party stealing unperceived round the principal and
nearest herd, so that presently it was between us. Gazing
at us as we rapidly approached, they angrily tossed their
heads, bounded into the air snorting and making most
extraordinary noises, and went off full gallop, the waving
mass of manes and tails flying before us with the
thundering of a thousand hoofs over the sun-baked
earth, which was covered so thickly with the skulls of
gnu and antelope, as to make it dangerous riding. A
fine old bull, with long white tail and mane, being detached
from the rest, was followed by three of us for
several miles, after which I found myself quite alone
in the pursuit. Every few hundred yards he would
turn round and stare at me, snorting and throwing up
his head; when I dismounted and fired, he kicked up his
heels into the air, wheeling about in the most fantastic
and absurd style, and off he cantered again, his tail
whisking round and round without ceasing; every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
now and then as if seized with some sudden whim, he
would spring into the air and go off harder than ever,
flinging out his heels right and left. In our course we
passed through several astonished herds with which
he appeared to have no acquaintance. Suddenly I
found myself in a perfect nest of large holes, the burrows
of wild-dogs, when the undermined earth breaking
through, my horse rolled over, the old wildebeest, not
300 yards off, looking at us as much as to say, <i>I knew
how it would be</i>. Without rising, I fired at his forehead;
the ball struck one of his horns with a sharp crack, he
butted savagely at the ground and flew off full speed.
My next bullet hit him in the neck, when he rushed
right at me, my horse running back in affright and
pulling the rein off my arm. I dropped behind an ant-heap
as he charged, and firing a pistol in his face which
made him swerve a few feet, his impetus carried him a
hundred yards beyond me, so that before he could wheel
round, I was on horseback again and reloading. He
darted off in a new direction, but had not gone far before
a shot in the leg brought him rolling to the ground in a
cloud of sand; but my triumph was short, he was up
and off again, though by this time only able to trot
quietly along; marking his track with drops of blood.
Sure of my game, I had just dismounted to give him
a finishing shot, when, to my astonishment, bang went
a score of rifles at him from just over a little ridge in
front, and the balls came <i>pinging</i> right over my head
most unpleasantly close. We had come suddenly on
the Column, and not many yards over the rise I found
a crowd of officers collected round the dead gnu. His
tail was cut off and presented to me. The Colonel having
lent his private mule waggon to convey the carcase
to camp, I had it taken there and it was skinned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and cut up; the meat, though totally devoid of fat,
proved of excellent flavour, and supplied the soup
kettles and frying pans for the next two days. We had
often heard that the brain of the wildebeest harbours
gentles or grubs, to which its wild extraordinary vagaries
are attributed, and being anxious to ascertain the truth
of such a strange phenomenon, the head was opened
by Dr. Fasson, R.A., in the presence of a number of
officers. In the very centre of the brain, still quite
warm, there was found a large maggot, which when put
on the table wriggled across it with great activity.
How such an animal comes there in the first instance,
how it exists, and propagates, and whether it really
causes the mad antics of the wildebeest, are questions
worthy the attention of naturalists.</p>

<p>Our tents had not long been pitched when hundreds
of wildebeest appeared not a mile off. Our Commanding
Officer, and all who had fresh horses, were off in a few
minutes, and right in the midst of the herds. After
some hours' excellent sport we brought in several calves
and one cow wildebeest; the veal was very good. A
wounded bull charged at Stapleton, of the 43rd, and
striking his horse about the shoulder, sent him and his
rider flying and rolling over on the ground.</p>

<p>An officer of the 2nd, who had formed one of our
hunting party of the early morning, was still absent. At
"tattoo," none of the others, who had straggled in during
the evening, having seen anything of him, great fears
were entertained for his safety. In the morning a party
of Cape Corps was sent back to look for him, and we
marched off in column of brigades. Though there was
an hour's interval between each brigade's starting, the
tail of the waggon train of each reached nearly to the
head of the body in its rear, the whole being in sight at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
once, winding slowly along the brown barren ocean-like
expanse in a continuous line of nearly five miles long.</p>

<p>In the evening, as the setting sun crimsoned the
warmly tinted rocks of the higher hills, whose base was
already veiled in shade and blue haze, we halted, after
twenty miles' weary march, at Sanna Spruits, in one large
encampment, placing outlying picquets of Cavalry on
the rising ground; the lances and pennons seen against
the glowing sky gave the groups a most picturesque
appearance. Two or three ostrich eggs were found in
the sand, and brought into camp; they made excellent
omelettes. Next day the face of the country slightly
improved, the grass approached nearer to green, and a
fine range of blue mountains was seen in the horizon,
some like domes with pointed minarets, others sharp
serrated peaks, and one or two resembling chimneys.</p>

<p>The scanty vegetation of the plains was varied now
and then by patches of orange, purple, and pink mesembryanthemum;
the beautiful hæmanthus, and brilliant
convolvulus; also by small yellow and scarlet poppies,
with sharp prickly leaves like the thistle.</p>

<p>We were greatly astonished at the frogs which
haunted the dry sandy desert, far from any springs or
water. They were enormous fellows, as big as a sheep's
haggis, and of a bright green; when we stirred them up
with a ramrod, they snapped at it like a dog, following
it round and round, and showing fight in the fiercest
manner.</p>

<p>Chameleons were common, and some of the scenes
among the men who stood amazed at their changes were
very amusing. The variety and quantity of lizards was
something incredible.</p>

<p>Immense green grasshoppers kept rising from the
ground on the line of march, fluttering before us with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
brilliant scarlet wings, and as in the colony, the lights in
our tents at night constantly attracted the strange looking
'mantis religiosa' or praying insect. It is an old story
that the Hottentots once worshipped them, and our men
used occasionally to chaff them on the point, offering
them specimens for the purpose, which invariably put the
Totties into a furious rage.</p>

<p>In peculiar states of the atmosphere, the mirage once
or twice made our thirsty mouths water in the broiling
afternoon, by its tantalizing illusion of large lakes
looming in the distance.</p>

<p>Late in the day two distant specks, like a couple of
little boats out at sea, were observed approaching the
column, and soon proved to be Tolcher, the missing
officer, and a Boer, who had fallen in with him near
Smithfield, the place we had left three days ago! One
night he had passed on the open plain, and had been
thirty hours without food or water when he fortunately
met the Dutchman, who took him to his farm for the
night, and brought him on after us the next day. As
always happens in such cases, now that he was safe back,
everybody who had before deeply deplored his fate,
heartily abused him for his stupidity in losing himself.</p>

<p>We had now fairly entered Moshesh's country, and no
more firing was allowed, lest he might construe it into
an act of hostility. About nine in the morning we
halted at the deserted remains of an old Basuto village,
consisting of round huts thatched with dry grass, and
stone cattle kraals, similar to the sheep pens on our
mountains at home. The huts differ in several respects
from those of the Kaffirs, being smaller, slightly pointed
on the top, and entered by a sort of porch, the door
so low as to compel one to enter on hands and knees.
Nine miles further, we came to the Lieuw Rivier (<i>Lion's
River</i>), and halted on the opposite bank, after wading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
waist deep through the narrow rushing stream. We
found the banks on both sides so steep and awkward
that before the waggons could be moved, the whole
force of Sappers and Miners, and a fatigue party beside,
had to cut the banks away with spades and picks, and
even then, with double teams of oxen, and a legion of
whips stretched across the river, all going at once, five
hours did not bring over more than half the train, the
rest remaining for the night, with a strong guard, on the
other side.</p>

<p>Now that we could not shoot, the game became
tantalizingly plentiful. The plain was scarcely ever
without small herds or single animals. Our track was
seldom more than the half-obliterated marks of some
trader's waggon of the year before.</p>

<p>The supplies of dung for fuel were very materially
interfered with by millions of black beetles, called 'dung
rollers,' a kind of scarabæus, which swarmed day after
day on every part of the plain. A fresh deposit was
instantaneously attacked by these untiring scavengers,
who were incessantly at work, rolling the dung into large
balls, bustling about, and running breech foremost, with
their load between their hind legs, as fast as they could
go, apparently to nowhere in particular, and fighting
most fiercely with each other for pieces of "fuel" twice
as big as themselves, the vanquished one going off in a
great hurry to get another ball to roll, none seeming to
know his own.</p>

<p>During the day we passed several small deserted
villages; the evening closed in with one of the thunderstorms
of the country, as terrific as any we had witnessed.</p>

<p>On the 13th, after some hours' marching, we descried
a column of smoke in the extreme distance, rising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the foot of an isolated table-topped mountain on our
right. It was said to be the celebrated Thaba Bassou,
or Bossigo, the stronghold of the Basuto Chief, Moshesh,
supposed by them to be impregnable. It is accessible
only at one or two points; very strong and defensible.
The Chief's residence was distinctly seen on its summit.
Some miles further on we came to the Wesleyan
Missionary station of Platberg, a little cluster of three
traders' houses, a chapel, and eight roofless dwellings,
formerly occupied by the Bastaards, under Carolus
Batjee, who, for having sided with the Government, was
driven hence, with his people, by Moshesh, from whom
they held the land. The Missionary and two English
traders had been suffered to remain. After having
accomplished a march of one hundred and one miles in
six days, (from the Caledon River,) we encamped on a
fine green plain immediately in front of the little station,
which stood, with its orchards of peach trees, at the
foot of a long flat-topped hill.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Moshesh's two sons, David and Nehemiah,
arrived at the camp with a few followers, having
swum the Caledon with their horses; but his Excellency
declined seeing them, as 'he only treated with ruling
chiefs.' From what we could learn, Moshesh was not
likely to make any opposition; his sons walked round
the camp with the Assistant-Commissioner, took great
interest in everything, and in their remarks and questions
showed a degree of information and intelligence
that perfectly astonished us. They were young fellows of
about one or two and twenty, of ordinary stature, quite
black, and very much of a Fingo cast of countenance.
Both spoke English most fluently and correctly, having
been educated at Cape Town, and talked of our Peninsular
War, of which they had read in Napier's History!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
They went into many of the officers' tents; closely
examined all the rifles and pistols they saw, and were
especially taken with some large conical and Minié
bullets, talking earnestly with each other in their own
language. Promising to return next day with their
father, they took their leave in the evening with great
politeness. Their wild-looking attendants, black as
night, armed with battleaxes, and covered only with a
short skin kaross on the left shoulder, led up their
horses like regular grooms, following them, on their way
home, at a respectful distance. Mr. Owen, the Assistant-Commissioner,
accompanied them to Thaba Bossigo.
At night there was another terrific storm of thunder
and lightning.</p>

<p>The day following we had the luxury of sitting under
the shade of the trees in the Missionary's garden, a
transition most delightful from the burning plains and
stifling heat of the tents. The Barolong Chief, Moroko,
who had ridden over from his village, on the neighbouring
mountain of Thaba 'Nchu, accompanied by two of
his sons and three Councillors, rode into Camp to pay his
respects to the Governor-General. They were well-dressed
in European clothes, and attended by about a
hundred mounted Barolongs in rags and old karosses,
armed with roers, battleaxes, and assegais. The strange
<i>cortège</i> brought every one out of the tents to look at it,
and as the old Chief rode through the Camp to the large
state marquee of His Excellency, he appeared quite astonished
at the number of troops, six hundred having been
the largest force that had ever before crossed the Orange
river. He was dressed in a blue surtout, with a double
row of very large brass buttons, and had on a large white
hat with the usual crape band. His hair was slightly grizzled,
and his appearance that of a quiet respectable old
gentleman. His sons were two fine tall young fellows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
They all halted and dismounted about thirty paces from
the marquee; when, leaving their horses, the Chiefs and
Councillors advanced to His Excellency's Interpreter,
who having received their message, shortly returned
with the Quarter-Master-General, and informed them
his Excellency would not see them till the morrow,
whereupon they bowed, and remounting rode to the
ruins of the little village, off-saddled and bivouacked for
the night. Some of us visited them soon afterwards,
and found the old Chief, who had changed his dress of
state for a large tiger-skin kaross, sitting under the
wall of an old house cross-legged on a large grass mat,
smoking within a circle of stones, which no one was
permitted to enter except the Councillors and his sons,
who assumed the title of <i>Princes</i>, and evidently thought
a good deal of themselves. Both spoke English very
well, and one was reading an English hymn-book; but
presently the "Princes" condescended to ask for some
tobacco, and were much pleased with half a dozen pieces
of 'cavendish;' and hinted, very unmistakably, that a
little tea and sugar would be agreeable! All wore round
their necks a curious flat sort of spoon of bright iron,
with which they clean their nostrils and scrape the perspiration
from their faces; and also, in a little ornamented
sheath of buckskin, a steel bodkin, with which
they make their grass baskets and karosses. After some
trouble, I concluded a bargain for one of each of these
articles, as curiosities, when one of the young chiefs
telling me to point out which I fancied, ordered the
two men who wore those I wanted, to take them off, each
receiving the tobacco and sixpences agreed for. It was
more difficult to obtain one of their battleaxes or
"Chakas," whether so called from the bloody and cruel
Chief of that name, or he from them, I know not. The
handle, from two feet to two feet and a half long, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
a large knob or head, is of solid rhinoceros horn, and has
an iron blade, varying in form and size, fixed in it.
After a long consultation in the Serolong tongue with
his Councillors, the old Chief told his son to inform me
that if I wanted it to take to my country and show it to
the Queen and my own people, respecting whom they
had asked many amusing questions, I might have one
(he had picked out one with a mended handle) for some
tea and sugar, and as many shillings as all his fingers,
which he held up. We finally agreed for six shillings
and some tea, for which his Royal Highness the heir
apparent came over to my tent. Several officers tried
afterwards to obtain similar curiosities from the Barolongs,
but they would not part with more. It may be
as well to observe here, that by a form of prefix
common to all the neighbouring tribes, the words Morolong,
Barolong and Serolong, stand respectively for an
<i>individual</i>, the <i>people</i>, and their <i>language</i>.</p>

<p>The following day the Paramount-Chief, Moshesh,
arrived with his Sons, Chief men and Councillors, and an
armed escort of about 100 men, though a larger number
had been left just out of sight of the camp over the
rising ground, probably as a precautionary measure.
Three tents had been pitched for him and his Staff at
some 300 yards from the camp, whither they repaired;
the chiefs and great men dismounting in front, and the
rest off-saddling in the rear of the tents.</p>

<p>After a long interval, the Chief came out of his tent,
dressed with great care, in a smart forage cap, blue coat,
and gold-laced trowsers! and, followed by his sons and
retinue, walked slowly across to the marquee of the
Governor-General, who received him in uniform, with all
his Staff. The following is a translation from the Basuto,
of the substance of what passed:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Gov.</i>&mdash;I am glad to see you, and make your acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mosh.</i>&mdash;I also am glad to see the Governor.</p>

<p><i>G.</i>&mdash;I hope we meet in peace?</p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;I hope so too; for peace is like the rain, which
makes the grass grow; while war is like the hot wind,
that dries it up.</p>

<p><i>G.</i>&mdash;I shall not talk much now. I wish to know if you
have got my letter, demanding the horses and cattle?</p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;I have received the letter, but know not where I
shall get the cattle. Are the 10,000 head you demand,
a fine for the thefts of my people, in addition to the
cattle stolen?</p>

<p><i>G.</i>&mdash;I demand only 10,000 head, though your people
have stolen many more. This is a just award, and must
be paid in three days.</p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;Do the three days count from yesterday, or to-day?</p>

<p><i>G.</i>&mdash;To-day is the first of the three.</p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;The time is short, and the cattle many. Allow
me six days to collect them. I have not power over my
people to make them do it.</p>

<p><i>G.</i>&mdash;If you are not able to collect them, I must go
and do it; and, if resistance is made, it will be war, and
I shall not be content with 10,000, but shall take all I
can.</p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;Do not talk of war! for, however anxious I may
be to avoid it, you know that a dog, when beaten, will
show his teeth.</p>

<p><i>G.</i>&mdash;It will therefore be better that you should give
up the cattle, than that I should go for them.</p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;I wish for peace, but have the same difficulty
with my people, that you have in your country; your
prisons are never empty, and I have thieves among my
people.</p>

<p><i>G.</i>&mdash;Then bring the thieves to me, that I may hang
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;I do not wish you to hang them, but to talk to
them. If you hang them, they cannot talk.</p>

<p><i>G.</i>&mdash;If I hang them they cannot steal. But I am not
here to talk. I have said, if you do not give up the
cattle in three days, I must come and take them.</p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;I beseech you not to talk of war.</p>

<p><i>G.</i>&mdash;I have no more to say. Go, and collect the cattle
as quickly as possible, or I shall have to come to Thaba
Bossigo.</p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;Do not talk of coming to Thaba Bossigo. I will
go at once, and perhaps God will help me.</p>

<p>After leaving the Governor-General, but before quitting
the camp, Moshesh sent to beg that this day might
not count in the three, to which his Excellency assented.</p>

<p>16th.&mdash;At six o'clock, the whole Division was reviewed
by the Commander-in-chief, "marching past," and performing
various evolutions and movements. A party of
Engineer officers being ordered to proceed with a small
escort to the drift on the Caledon River, some miles in
front, to survey its practicability, and the nature of the
country, in case of our further advance, I got leave to
accompany them. After riding about four miles, we
came on three villages very near together, all inhabited,
and with numerous herds of cattle, and many horses
feeding around. As we approached both unexpectedly
and rapidly, we had, what would have been otherwise
impossible, a full opportunity of seeing the natives at
their accustomed employments, as we passed within pistol
shot. The men were smoking, sitting and standing in
groups, and looked dumbfoundered at seeing us; the
women, who were pounding corn, or hoeing their millet
and sweet cane, fled with their children, on our sudden
appearance, to their huts in the greatest consternation,
never having seen so many white men before. As we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
rode through the herds of cattle, the terrified keepers,
whose only covering was a narrow belt of dressed hide
round the groin, jumped up from the long grass, and with
a short assegai drove in the cattle as fast as they could go.</p>

<p>Having sent one of our escort into the river at the first
drift, which was running very strong, it was found too
deep for waggons, infantry, or artillery, and we proceeded
seven miles further up along the bank. Our
guide, a trader, having come to the extent of his former
travels, was quite out of his reckoning. At the next
drift, we surprised a party of a dozen girls and women
bathing, and filling their calabashes. They gave a
yell of alarm as we suddenly appeared on the top of the
bank, and rushing out of the water up the opposite path
all dripping, made off to a large village perched on the
top of a rocky hill about a mile off, constantly looking
back to see if we were pursuing. Their dress was of the
same primeval description as that of the men, coverings
of skin, and they wore in addition large white necklaces.</p>

<p>We saw the small French Missionary station of Berea;
and at some distance Moshesh's <i>Great Place</i> on the
Thaba Bossigo. After the drift had been carefully examined
by Siborne, R.E., who swam his horse across
the swollen stream, and Tylden and Stanton had taken
the necessary points and bearings for their survey of the
country, we returned along the base of a fine hill, on
which were two or three little villages of stone kraals and
round huts, from whence we saw several natives peering
down on us. Shortly we were caught in a terrific storm
of hail, thunder, and lightning, and had the greatest
difficulty in keeping our road, and making the horses
face the hail, which pelted down with such force as to
hurt us very much, and render them frantic. No one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
have any just idea of an African thunderstorm without
experiencing it. The lightning ran along the ground,
and the rain streamed down in such torrents, that we were
all drenched to the skin in a minute, and sobbing with
the sudden cold. As we rode across the flooded plain,
the water flew from our horses' feet in sheets of spray, yet
in a quarter of an hour the sun was out again as bright as
ever. A party of civilians riding out from the camp,
as soon as they caught sight of us with our Fingo
escort, turned round, and went back at full gallop, tearing
away before us as hard as they could go, to our
great astonishment, and were very soon out of sight. On
arriving at the camp, we were congratulated on our safe
return, and found everybody in a state of excitement at
the narrow escape of a party from the camp, that had
been nearly cut off by a large mounted force of Basutos,
in fact barely getting away with their lives! Our version
of the matter changed the aspect of affairs entirely, and
the fugitives laughed as heartily as any one.</p>

<p>One or two large snakes were killed among the ruins
of the village, but the camp was free from them, although
we had other visitors, tarantulas being very common;
and after the second day, the whole of the tents
within were literally blackened with common flies, which
covered everything, hot or cold, the moment it appeared;
in one or two, jerboas made night visits, rather astonishing
us when the daylight showed the large holes
and heaps of fresh mould left on the floor. B&mdash;&mdash;n,
who was particularly nervous about all small animals,
seemed specially selected for annoyance; the holes filled
up with stones and empty bottles overnight were succeeded
by fresh ones, and he declared that his tormentors
awoke him by dancing and cheering round his tent
in the grey light of early dawn, and so alarmed him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
that he dared not put his arm out of bed to throw a
boot at them, but lay in a cold perspiration till people
began to move about, when they disappeared.</p>

<p>The water here was no better than the nauseating
stuff we had so often to drink in the field; and besides
the usual thickening of aquatic insects, still more objectionable
animals found their way to table in the
muddy mixture. B&mdash;&mdash; one day very narrowly escaped
tossing off a fine young frog in his tumbler of brandy
and water.</p>

<p>The waggon drivers, &amp;c., of whom, with upwards of
150 waggons and 2000 trek oxen, we had a perfect
army in camp, as usual took advantage of the halt
to lay in a stock of biltong; and every bush, waggon
wheel, and dissel-boom, was covered with strips of raw
meat drying in the sun.</p>

<p>Close to camp, and high up on the hill, were some
fine rocks, where, under the shadow of their overhanging
masses, we sat during the heat of the day,
looking down on the busy camp, and scanning the
plain for miles beyond. While thus occupied on the
19th, the last of the three days granted Moshesh, we
descried large herds of cattle approaching from Thaba
Bossigo. At three in the afternoon they were visible
from the camp; and soon afterwards a body of mounted
Basutos appeared, armed with assegais, stuck in a sort
of quiver at the back, with battleaxes at the saddle-bow,
and guns, keeries, and large shields of ox-hide,
followed by a vast herd of cattle stretching across the
plain, and coming on at a trot, driven by upwards of
500 natives. They were wild looking-fellows, with
strange head-gear of jackals' tails, ostrich feathers,
tiger skin, and gnu manes; with karosses, chakas, and
clubs. Though differing in no respect from the Kaffir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
personally, their language or dialect is widely dissimilar,
and sounded to us more musical. Our interpreters and
Fingoes could not understand it in the least, though
many travellers have affirmed the two languages are in
reality the same. Their saddles were most primitive
affairs, the stirrups, ingeniously contrived out of a
broad strip of hide, divided towards the lower end for
about six inches, and forming, with a piece of hard wood
as a base, a triangle for the foot. All wore the bodkins
and "lebakos," or iron strigils before mentioned, suspended
from the neck by a strip of finely dressed skin.
After the greatest difficulty, and with the assistance of
Jary, 12th Lancers, I obtained one of each for the small
consideration of five shillings in silver three-penny pieces,
and eight sticks of Cavendish tobacco. They were all
savage, surly-looking fellows, which might perhaps be
attributed to the nature of their errand, though one
could not expect any very pleasing expression in a
people who less than twenty years ago were cannibals,
and dressed their hair with human grease.</p>

<p>The cattle having been numbered, and found to
amount only to 3500, Prince Nehemiah, who had come
with them, was desired to inform his <i>Governor</i>, that
unless the remainder arrived the following morning, we
should be obliged to come and fetch them.</p>

<p>As an earnest of this threat, which produced no effect,
the Second Brigade, with two companies of the 74th
Highlanders, marched at daylight for the upper drift on
the Caledon leading to Moletsani's country; and there
formed a flying camp. But this demonstration not
having the desired effect, the Governor-General followed
at dawn on the 20th, with the Cavalry Brigade and two
guns. Moving along the western and southern base of
the Berea mountain, on the flat summit of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
enemy had collected their cattle, His Excellency advanced
to parley with a party of armed Basutos, who immediately
fired on him. Hostilities having thus commenced,
the cavalry were advanced in extended order,
and with a couple of rounds of shrapnel from the
guns, drove them off. His Excellency, who, notwithstanding
that his conspicuous appearance drew fire
on him from all directions, continued the whole day
coolly smoking his cheroot, and issuing his orders, then
crossed the Rietspruit, a deep mountain stream, and took
up a position on an eminence commanding the approaches
of the other two columns, which were to join him here,&mdash;viz.,
the Infantry Brigade, after clearing the summit of
the mountain, and the Cavalry by moving round its
north and east faces. Colonel Eyre, having sent up a
storming party of the Rifle Brigade, under Lieutenant
Hon. L. Curzon, and the Light Company of the 73rd,
under Lieutenant Gawler (who led their men up rocks
almost inaccessible, under a heavy fire from the enemy,
and drove them from their position), ascended the mountain,
and sweeping the top, completely dispersed the
enemy, capturing 1500 head of cattle. Unfortunately,
Captain Faunce, Deputy-Assistant Quarter-Master General,
and two or three of the 73rd, were surprised and
cut down by a party of Basutos, several of whom having
the white forage caps and the lances of the 12th
(killed in Colonel Napier's column), were mistaken for our
own troops, an error not discovered till it was too late
to be remedied.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the above movements, Colonel
Napier's Brigade having proceeded along the valley on
the north-east of the mountain, ascended it at a point
where large droves of cattle were observed; and after
some hard fighting&mdash;in which, more than once, they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
to close quarters, hand to hand, with lance and battleaxe,
twenty-five Lancers and two of the Cape Mounted
Rifles being killed, with a great number of the enemy&mdash;captured
4000 head of cattle, besides fifty-three horses,
and many goats, with the whole of which they returned
to the flying camp.</p>

<p>When the Infantry Brigade joined his Excellency, the
enemy, numbering between 6000 and 7000 horsemen,
man&oelig;uvring with the regularity and precision of English
troops, endeavoured to turn their right flank; attacking
both front and rear simultaneously, but were repulsed
with great loss in each attempt by the steady gallantry of
the troops. However, in spite of their repulse, they pertinaciously
returned to the assault of the bivouac on
the hill-side, where the cattle had been driven for the
night into some old stone kraals, and though suffering
heavy loss, continued in thousands attacking the position
on all sides at once, till after dark, when they were
finally dispersed by a round of canister, and the weary
troops, who since sunrise had never ceased a single moment
from their arduous toils, lay down to rest. When
day dawned next morning there was not a Basuto to be
seen. The casualties on our side, owing to the overpowering
force of the enemy, and the difficult nature of the
ground, were very severe: Captain Faunce, Dep.-Asst.-Quar.-Mr.-General,
and thirty-seven men, being killed,
and Captain Wellesley, Asst.-Adjt.-General, Lieut. Hon.
H. Annesley, 43rd, and fourteen men wounded.</p>

<p>The captured cattle being a great incumbrance, the
infantry were sent back with them to the camp, his
Excellency announcing his intention of resuming operations
the following day against the Chiefs residence; a
few cattle and horses abandoned on the plain were added
on the route; but soon after arriving at the Caledon camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
a warrior bearing a flag of truce presented himself with
a letter from Moshesh, written in Council at midnight,
after the engagement. The epistle ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
"<i>Thaba Bossigo</i>,<br />
"<i>Midnight, December 20th, 1852</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>"Your Excellency,&mdash;This day you have fought against
my people, and taken much cattle. As the object for
which you have come is to have a compensation for
Boers, I beg you will be satisfied with what you have
taken. I entreat peace from you. You have shown
your power; you have chastised; let it be enough, I pray
you, and let me no longer be considered an enemy of the
Queen. I will try all I can to keep my people in order
for the future.</p>

<div class="right">
Your humble servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Moshesh</span>."<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>His Excellency having seen fit to accept this submission,
concluded a peace with the humbled Chief, and
returned with his Staff&mdash;Colonel Cloete, Quarter-Master-General;
Colonel Seymour, Military Secretary;
Captain Lord A. Russell, Dep.-Asst.-Quarter-Master-General;
Captain Hon. R. Curzon, Captain Hon G.
Elliott, Captain Tylden, Lieut. Greville, Lieut. Lord C.
Hay, and Lieut. Earle, to the standing camp at Platberg;
and the troops afterwards arriving with the spoil,
the cattle were distributed. One thousand head
were given to Moroko, two hundred and fifty to
Taibosch, and two hundred and fifty to Carolus Batje for
their firm adherence to the government, and as a compensation
for their losses in consequence; the remainder
were granted as a boon to the Boers, who had suffered
to a great extent by the plundering and robberies of the
Basutos. The loud bellowing of the spoil, in which our
own 2000 draught oxen joined, was so insufferable, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
we were heartily glad to see them driven off by the
Barolongs to Bloem Fontein, going full canter across the
plain. There were so many young calves, which of
course were obliged to be left behind, that one was
allowed to each officer, and also to every soldier's 'mess,'
and the camp was full of veal. There was a sale of captured
horses, generally young colts, which fetched prices
varying from eight shillings to eight sovereigns. One or
two particularly 'choice lots' brought ten or twelve
pounds.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, a Gazette was published in camp, printed
at the Mission-house press, containing all the Despatches,
and Orders connected with the affair. The force was
ordered to return to the colony.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
MARCH DOWN THE COUNTRY&mdash;TERMINATION OF THE WAR.</h2>


<p>C&mdash;&mdash;, who had been unwell from the time of our
tremendous soaking the day we waded the Caledon river,
when we had to remain two hours standing in wet
clothes, waiting for the waggons crossing the drift, had
become so ill as to be unable to march. The excellent
missionary at Platberg, Mr. Giddy, had shown him the
greatest kindness possible, doing everything in his power
to add what comforts he could to the hard fare of camp
life. He was now placed in an ox waggon, which, jolting
and bumping over the rocky road, crept slowly on step by
step of the long and weary journey homewards. At our
first night's halt, the Assistant-Commissioner, Mr. Owen,
who had ridden over to Thaba Bossigo, rejoined us. He
had had a friendly interview with Moshesh, who gave
him a capital breakfast, with European appliances of
great variety; and among other luxuries, placed before
him a bottle of port and a couple of large jars of Gunter's
preserves! He strongly expressed his anxiety to
maintain peace, and stand on an amicable footing with
the Government; and when Mr. Owen mentioned his
wish that the bodies of our brave men who had fallen,
should be interred, he sent his sons with a few Basutos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
to dig graves, and assist Mr. Owen's party. The body
of Capt. Faunce was recognised, and laid in a separate
grave.</p>

<p>December 25th, Christmas day.&mdash;Scorched by the sun
from above and the sand under foot, the long waving
column moved slowly across the dead sun-baked karroo,
and when late in the day it halted at Lieuw Rivier, we
felt as though we would give all we possessed for a little
of the ice and snow with which our far distant friends
were doubtless at that moment surrounded. Some
attempted the manufacture of a plum pudding with
corn meal, black sugar, and currants boiled in a tin-tot
tied up in a pocket handkerchief; but it was even a more
miserable failure than the roast beef which, instead of
being made into the usual soup, was placed upon the
table like a piece of burnt leather. The generous liquor
with which these luxuries were washed down, was Dutch
gin and muddy water.</p>

<p>In the evenings, as soon as the glowing sun had sunk
behind the distant ranges of pale purple mountains, the
temperature was delightful. We collected in knots, and
stretched on plaids or tiger-skins on the sand, enjoyed
our pipes, watching the few light and brightly tinted
clouds that floated airily in the warm sky; the droves of
cattle and mules, and troops of cavalry horses returning
from their short pasture; the busy camp before us,
where, as the darkness fell, the glowing fires showed
themselves; or the bright stars that shone out one after
another in the blue heaven like so many globes of light.
Moments such as these, compensated for the toil and
heat of the day.</p>

<p>27th.&mdash;On arriving at our encamping ground, C&mdash;&mdash;
was so much worse that a Medical Board was held on
him at once, and leave to England recommended; before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the rear of the column was up, we were off after
the Governor-General's column, which had gone on in
advance. Colonel MacDuff, in the kindest and most
generous manner, tumbled everything out of his
own mule waggon, and gave it up at once, to enable
us to overtake and keep up with them. After a sharp
trot of ten miles without any escort whatever, we were
very glad to see his Excellency's little camp about a mile
ahead. The whole plain at this point was completely
whitened with endless flocks of migratory storks, apparently
feeding on the locusts which were flying over in
clouds. They were quite close to the waggon track on
both sides. The unexpected appearance of a single
horseman and waggon approaching across the solitary
plain at such a late hour, brought out several officers, by
whom we were most cordially and hospitably received,
his Excellency also kindly sending to offer the invalid
anything his better cuisine afforded.</p>

<p>At three o'clock next morning, we trekked along with
the cavalry and mule train at six miles an hour, a change
most delightful after the slow pace of the ox waggons.
Numbers of springbok and blesbok were seen in every
direction, and 'jagged' whenever near enough to render
it easy to overtake the party again, which was a very
different affair from catching up the infantry column.
After a good thirty miles, we came early in the afternoon
to the Caledon River, which, though running very
strong, was just fordable for the waggons, and encamped
on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>C&mdash;&mdash;, who had eaten nothing for four days but a few
teaspoonfuls of dirty brown arrow-root, made with muddy
vley water, and sweetened with black ration sugar, grew
rapidly worse, and towards evening became quite
unconscious; all night long, as I watched under the
waggon, he wandered, and talked incoherently of home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>When all were gone to rest, the most perfect silence
reigned through the camp: the night was splendid,&mdash;the
clear bright heavens were studded with brilliant stars
down to the very horizon,&mdash;the moon glided along in
silvery light over the vast plain, on which imagination
pictured thousands of wild animals sleeping or feeding
in undisturbed enjoyment,&mdash;till the creaking of the
waggon, as poor C&mdash;&mdash; tossed about on his miserable
bed, recalled one's thoughts to realities.</p>

<p>It wanted an hour to daylight, and the stars still
shone with undiminished brightness, when suddenly the
loud clear notes of the reveillé, never before welcomed,
rung out from the head-quarter tent, and were taken
up and repeated on all sides by the bugles and trumpets
of each detachment; the general hum through the
camp soon told that all were astir, and the toils of
another day commenced.</p>

<p>The first few hours were delightfully cool and pleasant;
but as the sun rose higher, it became less and less agreeable,
and long before we came in sight of the distant
belt of trees that marked the course of the Orange River
the heat was again intense.</p>

<p>As the river was "up," and there were no means of
crossing except by the pontoons and a large flat-bottomed
ferry-boat, it was necessary to encamp on the bank
during the tedious operation of getting the waggons
over. The mules were first embarked, and as there
were some 300, all of which objected most obstinately
to going on board, it was not effected all at once. One
by one the waggons were spoked to the top of the bank
and let down by ropes, the boat accommodating one
only at a time. All night long the waggons were going
across by moonlight; the Dutchmen as well as the
officers and men taking watches of four hours. Next morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
when it came to our turn to cross, the thoughtful and
feeling soldiers, scarce speaking above a whisper, let
down "the sick officer's waggon" with the greatest care.
When about half way across the river, one of the long
sweeps worked by the Lancers broke in two, and we
were carried some distance down the rapid stream, and
at last got entangled among the thick willow-trees
below the landing place. A hawser was, with some
difficulty, got ashore, and the fatigue party passing it
from tree to tree, endeavoured to haul us to an opening,
but the rope broke, and in a moment we were whirled
round and drifting away towards a dangerous rapid in
the middle of the river, the Dutchmen from the ferry
screaming to us to keep away from the rocks. But it
was much easier to say what to do, than to effect it
with one lumbering sweep; in another minute we must
all have been "gethan" (<i>done</i>), as the Boers prophesied,
when a puffing snorting black head, with a rope
between its teeth, appeared swimming bravely astern,
and a dripping Fingo clambered into the punt with a
cable from shore. We were again hauled up to the
trees, through which the stream swept with resistless
strength, carrying us against the large overhanging
branches with such force as nearly to capsize the waggon
out of the boat. Four or five Sappers with axes, under
direction of Stanton, were in the tree in an instant; while
others, swimming about in the boiling flood, cleared away
the boughs, and at last we were moored to the bank, but it
was so high and perpendicular, as well as thickly wooded,
that the waggon had to be entirely unloaded (C&mdash;&mdash;
being carried up in a stretcher), and several large trees
felled before the waggon could be got to the top with
the united efforts of four and twenty mules and some
scores of fellows with tow-ropes and levers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Night again came round, and still a third of the camp
remained on the other side.</p>

<p>In the morning, as we breakfasted under the trees on
the edge of the lofty bank, admiring the bright sunny
river and its green islands, it was curious to see the
cavalry horses swim across, following a mounted Totty.
The stream had considerably abated, and they landed
safely, and at a very little distance below the drift-path.
His Excellency and Staff followed in the pontoon, and
our march was resumed.</p>

<p>It was New Year's Day when we again reached
Burghersdorp; brand-new waggons painted the brightest
red, yellow, and blue, drawn by sleek spans of fat oxen,
and filled with Boers, vrouws and children, dressed in
their holiday clothes, were pouring into the town; others
stood outspanned in groups, with tents pitched round
them; the stores were all closed, and service was going
on in the church.</p>

<p>Thirty miles a day soon brought us back to the
Colony; our eyes were once more delighted with the
sight of trees; the bush looked lovely; the mimosas were
one sheet of golden blossom, filling the air with the
most fragrant perfume; and jessamine, bignonia, and
plumbago, with numbers of beautiful flowering bulbs,
appeared at every step,&mdash;a change most grateful to all
after the bare and arid wilderness we had so long been
traversing.</p>

<p>On the 9th of January we reached the Blinkwater
standing camp, where we met many old friends, and
the same evening got to Fort Beaufort, where C&mdash;&mdash;,
whose shoulders were bleeding from the constant jolting
of the waggon, was moved from his rough, narrow bed,
to a four-poster at the little inn; and the kind-hearted
Mrs. Mills replaced his awkward nurses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>No outbreak or disturbance whatever had taken place
among the thoroughly dispersed Kaffirs, nor had any case
of cattle stealing occurred during the long absence of so
large a portion of the army.</p>

<p>The Waterkloof, so long contested and dearly won,
was at length entirely evacuated by the enemy, and held,
without molestation, by very small garrisons.</p>

<p>Seyolo, the T'slambie Chief, one of Sandilli's principal
supporters, and a most warlike and active leader in the
rebellion, was a prisoner at Cape Town, where, not long
afterwards, I visited him in his cell.</p>

<p>Moshesh, the head of the Basutos, we had left at
Thaba Bassou, humbled enough, and only too desirous
to maintain peace.</p>

<p>In Tambookie Land everything was perfectly quiet,
the Tambookies having settled down in profound peace,
in their appointed location; and more than 800 applications
had been sent in by the Burghers for farms
in the unappropriated districts.</p>

<p>Kreli was suing for peace.</p>

<p>The Amatolas and Gaika district were entirely cleared
of Kaffirs and Hottentots; Sandilli and the other Chiefs
had fled beyond the Kei, and the whole tribe was
dispersed.</p>

<p>Thus the war was now virtually brought to an end;
the rebel tribes being everywhere vanquished or enfeebled,
and the happy effects of restored tranquillity
already began to be felt in the country. The settlers,
who had fled to the towns for refuge from the outrages
of the enemy, began to return to their devastated farms,&mdash;the
neglected fields were once more under the plough&mdash;their
ruined houses were again roofed in,&mdash;and even
those unfortunate farmers, whom a second and a third
war might well have driven to hopeless despair, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
courage, and, like the ph&oelig;nix, the promise of future
prosperity once more rose from the ashes of their
blackened homesteads.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards Peace was proclaimed, and
General Cathcart was enabled to withdraw a large
portion of the forces from the scene of their long and
harassing campaign. The Rifle Brigade were ordered
for home, and the 12th Lancers, 43rd Light Infantry,
and 74th Highlanders to India.</p>

<p>After two days' rest, C&mdash;&mdash; was again placed in a
mule waggon, and, with a small cavalry escort, we proceeded
by easy stages to Grahams Town and thence
to Port Elizabeth, reaching the little harbour on the
fourth day. The change, and fresh sea breezes had
a wonderful effect on the invalid. One day, a huge
steamer hove in sight, which brought wondering
crowds to the shore, and rapidly steaming in, proved
to be the famed "Great Britain," when, after all the
hardships, sufferings, and privations of the campaign,
I had the satisfaction of seeing him in a comfortable
berth homeward bound.</p>

of the Expedition. Original Portraits of Druse and Maronite Chiefs, and
Illustrative Landscape Drawings, by F. Halpen, Esq.</p>

<div class="center">MOUNT LEBANON<br />
A TEN YEARS' RESIDENCE, FROM 1842 TO 1852.
</div>

<p>With Descriptive Sketches of its Scenery, Productions, &amp;c.; the Manners and
Customs of its Inhabitants, particularly of the Druses and Maronites; and a
full and correct account of the Druse Religion, Historical Records of the
Mountain Tribes, from Personal Intercourse with their Chiefs, and other
Authentic Sources.</p>

<div class="center">By COLONEL CHURCHILL,<br />
Staff Officer of the British Expedition to Syria.
</div>

<p>"This is one of the most important as well as most interesting works, not of the day, but of
the age. The very name of 'Mount Lebanon' commands an involuntary attention, and these
volumes are worthy of their subject. Colonel Churchill writes from personal observation, not
as a cursory traveller, but a settled resident. His judgment is sound, his observation extensive
and yet minute, his style vigorous and unaffected, and thus he has been enabled to give the
world the most valuable fruits of opportunities never surpassed respecting a locality of worldwide
interest."&mdash;<i>Lit. Chron.</i></p>

<p>"This is a serious and thoughtful book. The wit of 'Eothen,' and the fancy displayed in the
'Crescent and the Cross,' are here superseded by earnest researches into the social condition of
the Syrians, their religious feelings, their diversity of tribes and manner of life, and recent
historical occurrences which intercourse with the chief actors and living authorities has enabled.
Colonel Churchill to record."&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

<p>"There can be no doubt that Col. Churchill's 'Mount Lebanon' is the most complete work
on the subject that has been given to the public. The history of the Druse religion forms a
most interesting and important feature in these volumes."&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p>

<p>"Of the Druses, Colonel Churchill gives us by far the best account we possess. The
Maronite Christians are depicted with a minuteness that leaves nothing to be desired; and of
Lebanon itself he has presented a complete picture, geographical and physical&mdash;its aspect in
the various seasons, its animal and vegetable inhabitants, the productions of its soil, its capacity
for agriculture and manufactures, its commerce, its arts, its manners, its customs; the social
condition of its people, their political and economical organization, their land tenures, their
religion, and their superstitions."&mdash;<i>Critic.</i></p>

<p>"As a body of information upon the state of this very interesting country; upon the
manners, customs, and historical traditions of its inhabitants; and upon its position relatively
to the political questions that now agitate Europe, we cannot too highly praise Col. Churchill's
work."&mdash;<i>New Quarterly.</i></p>

<p>"Colonel Churchill's work contains all that is necessary to be known of the geography, the
products, the past history, and the present prospects of the Lebanon. It contains the best
account we have yet received of a country the natural fortress between the Eastern and Western
world, which is destined again to rise into importance. We could scarcely point to a narrative
which illustrates more strikingly the peculiar features of Oriental character, and the wonderful
vicissitudes of Oriental life. 'Mount Lebanon' is a valuable addition to our geographical and
historical literature."&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>"It abounds in curious and interesting details, and contains much unfamiliar knowledge.
It is a book that in point of information will leave no man as it found him; and it is also as
entertaining as works on Oriental matters almost always are. The elaborate account of the
Druse religion is extremely valuable."&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>"It is not for a moment to be disputed, that all that has before been done for this subject is
surpassed by that which has been accomplished by Col. Churchill in this work; and the conjunction
in his case of the most favourable opportunity, distinguished ability, and thorough
interest in his task, has rendered his volumes equally remarkable for their literary attractiveness,
and their social and political value. Col. Churchill's now complete and reliable work
cannot fail to be highly esteemed, and to attract general attention."&mdash;<i>Nonconformist.</i></p>

<p>"These volumes are very curious and interesting, containing abundant details of a country
so little known as Mount Lebanon, personally collected and herein ably communicated by
Colonel Churchill."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
